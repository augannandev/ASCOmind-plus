# ASCOmind+ Cancer-First UI Revamp

## 🎯 Overview

This is a complete UI revamp of ASCOmind+ that implements a **cancer-type-first approach**. Instead of uploading files first, users now:

1. **Select a Cancer Type** from a beautiful card-based interface
2. **View Pre-cached Analytics** and visualizations instantly
3. **Chat with AI Assistant** that only knows about the selected cancer type
4. **Access Specialized Insights** tailored to that specific cancer

## 🚀 New Features

### Cancer-Type Selection
- **Visual Cancer Cards**: Beautiful cards for each cancer type with icons, descriptions, and stats
- **10 Supported Cancer Types**: Multiple Myeloma, Breast Cancer, Lung Cancer, Colorectal, Lymphoma, Leukemia, Melanoma, Ovarian, Pancreatic, Prostate
- **Specialized Configurations**: Each cancer type has unique specializations, endpoints, and treatments

### Pre-cached Analytics
- **Instant Loading**: All visualizations and summaries are pre-generated and cached
- **Cancer-Specific Dashboards**: Tailored metrics and insights for each cancer type
- **Smart Caching**: Automatic cache management with expiration and refresh

### Segmented AI Assistant
- **Cancer-Focused**: AI only searches and answers questions related to the selected cancer type
- **Pinecone Filtering**: Vector search is filtered by cancer type for accurate responses
- **Specialized Knowledge**: Different system prompts and knowledge bases per cancer type

## 📁 New Files Created

### Core Components
- `config/cancer_types.py` - Cancer type definitions and configurations
- `agents/cache_manager.py` - Pre-generation and caching system
- `main_cancer_first.py` - New cancer-first UI implementation

### Enhanced Components
- `agents/vector_store.py` - Updated with cancer-type filtering
- Vector metadata now includes `cancer_type` field
- Search methods filter by cancer type automatically

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Cancer Type Configuration
```python
# Each cancer type has:
- Display name and description
- Custom icon and colors
- Specializations (subtypes)
- Key clinical endpoints
- Typical treatments
```

### Caching System
```python
# Pre-generated and cached:
- Visualizations (comprehensive dashboard)
- Summaries (analysis results)
- Abstract data (processed metadata)
- Expires after 24 hours by default
```

### Vector Store Segmentation
```python
# Pinecone filtering by:
- cancer_type: Filters to selected cancer
- session_id: Maintains data isolation
- confidence_score: Quality filtering
- study_type: Clinical trial phases
```

## 🎨 UI/UX Improvements

### Design System
- **Enhanced CSS**: Modern gradients, shadows, and animations
- **Responsive Layout**: Works on desktop and mobile
- **Cancer-Specific Theming**: Each cancer type has unique colors
- **Loading States**: Smooth loading indicators and spinners

### User Experience
- **Intuitive Flow**: Cancer selection → Dashboard → Chat
- **Quick Access**: Pre-loaded data means instant insights
- **Specialized Content**: Everything is tailored to the selected cancer
- **Easy Navigation**: Simple back button to change cancer types

### Interactive Elements
- **Hover Effects**: Cards lift and highlight on hover
- **Smooth Transitions**: CSS animations for better feel
- **Visual Feedback**: Loading states and status indicators
- **Accessible**: Proper contrast and keyboard navigation

## 🚀 Running the New UI

### Start the New Application
```bash
streamlit run main_cancer_first.py
```

### Environment Setup
Make sure these environment variables are set:
```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_key
PINECONE_INDEX_NAME=your_index_name
```

## 📊 Cache Management

### Pre-generation Process
```python
# To pre-generate all caches:
cache_manager = CancerSpecificCacheManager()
await cache_manager.pregenerate_all_cancer_caches(
    visualizer, analyzer, data_by_cancer_type
)
```

### Cache Structure
```
data/cache/
├── multiple_myeloma/
│   ├── multiple_myeloma_visualizations.pkl
│   ├── multiple_myeloma_summary.pkl
│   └── multiple_myeloma_abstracts.pkl
├── breast_cancer/
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

## 🤖 AI Assistant Integration

### Cancer-Specific Prompts
Each cancer type gets specialized system prompts with:
- Domain-specific knowledge
- Relevant clinical terminology
- Appropriate treatment contexts
- Cancer-specific endpoints

### Vector Search Filtering
```python
# Automatic filtering by cancer type
filters = {
    'cancer_type': selected_cancer_type,
    'min_confidence': 0.8
}
results = await vector_store.search_abstracts(query, filters)
```

## 🔄 Migration from Old UI

### Gradual Migration
- Old UI remains in `main.py`
- New UI in `main_cancer_first.py`
- Can run both in parallel during transition

### Data Compatibility
- Uses same data models (`ComprehensiveAbstractMetadata`)
- Compatible with existing agents (analyzer, visualizer)
- Reuses existing processing pipelines

## 🎯 Benefits

### For Users
- **Faster Access**: No file uploads needed
- **Better Focus**: Cancer-specific insights only
- **Improved Experience**: Beautiful, modern interface
- **Intelligent Chat**: More accurate AI responses

### For System
- **Better Performance**: Pre-cached data loads instantly
- **Reduced Load**: Less real-time processing needed
- **Better Search**: Cancer-type filtering improves accuracy
- **Scalable**: Easy to add new cancer types

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Data Upload per Cancer Type**: Allow users to upload cancer-specific abstracts
- **Cross-Cancer Comparisons**: Compare treatments across cancer types
- **Real-time Updates**: Auto-refresh caches when new data arrives
- **User Preferences**: Save favorite cancer types and settings

### Technical Improvements
- **Advanced Caching**: More sophisticated cache invalidation
- **Better Embedding**: Cancer-specific embedding models
- **Performance Optimization**: Lazy loading and streaming
- **Analytics**: Track usage patterns per cancer type

## 📞 Support

For questions about the new cancer-first UI:
1. Check the cache status in the Settings tab
2. Use the "Refresh Cache" button if data seems stale
3. Verify environment variables are set correctly
4. Check logs for any caching or vector store errors
