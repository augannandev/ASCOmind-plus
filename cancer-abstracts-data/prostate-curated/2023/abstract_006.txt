HLA-A2-restricted AR ligand-binding domain (LBD) has been demonstrated to stimulate cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) in HLA-A2+ prostate cancer patients. Although the prevalence of HLA-A2 serotype and LBD-specific CD8+ T cells among Caucasians are known, their frequencies in the Taiwan patients have not been established. In this study, we performed HLA-A2 genotyping, HLA-A2+ LNCaP stimulation of autologous T cell, and CTL tumor cell cytotoxicity from 25 castration-sensitive prostate cancer patients using blood samples collected from a single hospital center. Methods: 20ml whole blood samples are collected in EDTA tube from non-metastatic, castration-sensitive prostate cancer patients. PBMCs are subjected to HLA-A2 allele sequencing, separated by CD3 magnetic bead column, and expanded and activated ex vivo using CD3/CD8 polymeric beads. Autologous T cells are then isolated by CD8 magnetic bead column, stimulated by HLA-A2+ lentivirus-transduced LNCaP (AR+), and targeted against transduced (HLA-A2+) and non-transduced (HLA-A2-) LNCaP (AR+) by Chromium-51 Release Assay. We identified and correlated their frequencies with patient’s age at diagnosis, Gleason grades, PSA level, and family history. Results: A total of 25 blood samples were tested and analyzed for HLA-A2 genotype with 44% (11/25) positive for the HLA-A2 [28% (7/25) heterozygotes, 16% (4/25) homozygotes]. Among the 11 HLA-A2+ patients, 72% (8/11) were HLA-A*02:07 allele, 100% (11/11) CD8+ T cells were successfully stimulated with HLA-A2+ transduced LNCaP (AR+) and 45% (5/11) patients demonstrated HLA-A2+ AR-specific CTL tumor cell lysis. No clinical association with patient age (54-86 y.o.), Gleason grades (6-9), PSA level (3.84-62.8 ng/ml), and family history (1/25). Conclusions: In this single hospital center study, we observed a similar prevalence of HLA-A2 alleles in Taiwan prostate cancer patient cohort with a predominant HLA-A2*02:07 allele, and higher frequencies of HLA-A2-restricted CD8+ T cell stimulation and HLA-A2+ AR-specific tumor cell cytotoxicity. Our findings support the application of AR LBD as tumor antigen for prostate cancer vaccine development for Taiwan prostate cancer patients.
