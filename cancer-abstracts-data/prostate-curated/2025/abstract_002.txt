CCTG IND.232 suggested that combination ICI with DT has efficacy in a subset of mCRPC but should be biomarker-directed. In this sub-study (SS) of the PC-BETS master protocol, we explored DT in ARPI-resistant mCRPC stratified by circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis. Methods: Pts had ECOG PS 0–1, evaluable disease, biochemical or radiographic progression, prior ARPI ± cytotoxic chemotherapy (max 1 in castrate resistant setting). Genomic screening tested plasma ctDNA and matched leukocyte DNA via deep targeted sequencing with a prostate cancer-specific panel including coding regions and introns of selected mismatch repair genes and estimating tumor mutational burden. Only pts with evidence of ctDNA ≥1% were eligible. Pts with a positive biomarker (BM+) on ctDNA were assigned to a specific SS by a molecular tumor board (MTB); BM- pts were randomized between SS. SS- F tested DT in 2 cohorts of pts: cohort 1: BM+ pts had either somatic hypermutation (HM) ± concomitant MMR gene alterations, or CDK12 mutations, cohort 2: BM- pts without these alterations, in a 2-stage design. Primary endpoint was clinical benefit rate (CBR), defined by PSA50 response, RECIST CR/PR, or SD ≥12 weeks. Pts received T 225mg IV once on cycle 1, day 1 and D 1500mg IV day 1 every 4 weeks. Results: From January 2020 to February 2024, 25 pts were enrolled: 15 and 10 to cohort 1 and 2, respectively. Median age was 69y (63-84). Five pts had liver mets, 15 pts had had prior cytotoxics. 9 pts in cohort 1 had HM and the remainder had CDK12 mutations only. Median N cycles given was 4 (1-45). 12 pts had a delayed or interruption of DT dosing. The most common related AEs were fatigue (36%), rash (36%), and diarrhea (32%). CBR was seen in 53% of BM+ pts: all also had PSA response and significantly higher median ctDNA% (34% vs 5%; 5-69%); no patient selected as BM+ due to CDK12 mutations had CBR, while 8 of 9 pts selected based on HM had CBR. Conclusions: Liquid biopsy biomarker-informed treatment with DT demonstrated very promising efficacy in mCRPC pts with HM and merits further evaluation. CDK12 mutations were not predictive of CBR. Toxicities experienced were characteristic of ICI.
