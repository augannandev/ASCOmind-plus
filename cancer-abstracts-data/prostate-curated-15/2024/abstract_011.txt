Lee Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL Abstract Disclosures Research Funding Conquer Cancer Foundation of the American Society of Clinical Oncology Background: ARVs that develop early during treatment with abiraterone acetate/ prednisone (AA/P) may play a role in treatment resistance. We evaluated metastatic site and whole blood mRNA expression of full-length AR (AR-FL) and ARVs to characterize treatment-emergent ARVs (TE-ARVs) from men with mCRPC pre- and post- 12 weeks of AA/P collected in a prospective clinical trial (NCT#01953640). Methods: RNAseq performed on paired metastatic site biopsy (n = 40) and whole blood (n = 25) passed quality control. Reads were aligned to the GRCh38 reference genome with the spliced-alignment TopHat2 package. AR-FL or ARVs were detected if ≥ 2 splice reads aligned to unique splice junctions for AR-FL, AR-8, AR-45, AR-23, AR-V3, AR-V5V6, AR-V7, AR-V8, AR-V9, AR-V10, AR-V12, AR-V13, and AR-V14, and normalized to splice reads per million (SRPM). Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was performed on AR-FL and AR-Vs with ≥1 SRPM for association with time to treatment change (TTTC). Results: In metastatic site biopsies post-AA/P, the average number of splice reads was 27,376,541 (range 7,753,998 to 62,456,773). The median number of ARVs detected was 2 (range 0-8), with a total of total of 110 ARVs identified (Table). Dynamic shifts in ARV profiles were observed post-AAP, with 41 TE-ARVs identified in 17 unique patients. The most common TE-ARV was AR-8 (n = 8), followed by AR-45 (n = 5), AR-23 (n = 5), and AR-V7 (n = 4). The presence of AR-V7 post-AAP was adversely associated with TTTC (hazard ratio 2.46, p = 0.013). The identification of early TE- ARV was not associated with TTTC. In whole blood samples, post-AA/P detection of AR-FL was low (n = 3) and no ARVs were detected. Conclusions: No specific patterns were observed in ARV profiles obtained in the metastatic biopsies after 12 weeks of treatment with AA/P. Clinical trial information: 01953640.
