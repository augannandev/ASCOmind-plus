Rosner Organizations Center for Prostate Disease Research, Bethesda, MD; CPDR-USU, Bethesda, MD; Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Washington, DC; Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center at Jefferson, Philadelphia, PA Abstract Disclosures Research Funding Other Government Agency Background: Prostate cancer (PCa) incidence and mortality disproportionately burden African American (AA) men compared to Caucasian American (CA) men. An interplay of biological, social, and health care factors is blamed for this disparity. However, a recent multi-center study of the Veterans Affairs population found no differences in cancer progression, disease specific survival, or overall survival for AA versus CA men. This study examines a large, racially diverse military health care beneficiary cohort, enrolled over 25+ years, to examine the roles of race and comorbidity on metastasis-free and overall survival. Methods: The Center for Prostate Disease Research (CPDR) multi-center national database was the source of study subjects. Eligible patients included all men who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) as primary treatment for PCa between January 1, 1990 to December 31, 2017. Comprehensive demographic, clinical, treatment, and outcomes data were collected on all enrollees. Unadjusted Kaplan-Meier estimation curves and multivariable Cox proportional hazards analysis with adjustment for key clinical and pathologic factors were used to examine BCR-free, metastasis-free, and overall survival as a function of patient self-reported race (AA vs. CA). Results: There were 7,135 eligible men, among whom 22% self-reported as AA. Median age at RP and follow-up were 62 and 6.9 years, respectively. A total of 1521 BCR events, 210 metastasis events, and 879 deaths occurred. Compared to CA men, AA men were younger at diagnosis (59.4 vs. 62.7 years, p < 0.05) with higher median PSA (5.8 vs. 5.5 ng/mL, p < 0.05); however, NCCN risk strata, as well as clinical and pathologic stage and grade were distributed comparably across race. Despite slightly poorer BCR-free survival for AA men in both unadjusted and adjusted analysis, there were no statistically significant differences in 5-, 10-, and 15-year probabilities for metastasis-free or overall survival. Conclusions: In this racially diverse equal-access health care setting, this longitudinal cohort study revealed no differences in distant metastasis or overall survival between AA and CA men. Future work will examine molecular signatures of metastatic cancer.
