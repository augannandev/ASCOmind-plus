Therapies directed against Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) -such as radiolabeled antibodies, chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-Ts) and T-cell engaging bispecific antibodies (T-BsAbs)- have shown promising efficacy but also induce significant toxicity. In particular T-cell redirection leads to efficient killing of tumor cells but induces cytokine release-related toxicities. We have developed a panel of monovalent and biparatopic CD3xPSMA bispecific antibodies that eliminate prostate tumor cells while minimizing cytokine release. Methods: Antibodies targeting CD3 and PSMA were generated in transgenic rats (UniRat™, OmniFlic™) followed by deep sequencing of the antibody repertoire from draining lymph nodes in immunized animals, and high-throughput gene assembly/expression. PSMA x CD3 T-BsAbs were assembled and evaluated for stability, pharmacokinetics, and T cell activation and ability to eliminate PSMA+ tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. Results: Bispecific CD3xPSMA Abs. incorporating either monovalent or biparatopic anti-PSMA binding domains activated T-cells in the presence of PSMA (plate-bound or cell surface), while no T cell activation occurred in the absence of either PSMA antigen or bispecific antibody. Potent/selective cytotoxicity against PSMA+ cells was observed in co-cultures of primary human T cells and tumor cells treated with CD3xPSMA T-BsAbs. Similar results were observed in in vivo Xenograft models of prostate cancer. Strikingly, CD3xPSMA bispecifics containing a novel low affinity anti-CD3 domain produced similar levels of tumor cytotoxicity compared to those with a traditional high affinity anti-CD3 domain, but with reduced cytokine production. Conclusions: We have created novel CD3xPSMA bispecific antibodies incorporating both monovalent and biparatopic anti-PSMA binding domains that mediate T-cell killing of PSMA+ tumor cells with minimal production of cytokines. Such T-BsAbs may improve safety, efficacy, and opportunities for combination therapy to treat CRPC.
