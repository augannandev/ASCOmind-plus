TRC253 inhibits AR nuclear translocation as well as AR binding to DNA and is a transcription antagonist. TRC253 treatment is efficacious in an LNCaP xenograft model driven by F877L mutant AR. Methods: In P1 dose escalation, pts with mCRPC previously treated with an AR inhibitor were assigned to increasing TRC253 doses of 40-320 mg daily. Dose escalation followed single-pt dose escalation design for the 40, 80 mg cohorts and expanded to 3+3 design in the 160, 240, 280, and 320 mg cohorts to assess safety, determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), and evaluate prostate-specific antigen response at week 12. Toxicity and efficacy assessments used NCI-CTCAE v4.03 and PCWG3 criteria, respectively. Pts were centrally screened by circulating tumor DNA using the BEAMing digital PCR assay. Results: Twenty-two pts were enrolled in phase 1 at TRC253 doses of 40 (n = 1), 80 (n = 1), 160 (n = 2), 240 (n = 6), 280 (n = 4), and 320 mg (n = 8) daily in 28-day cycles. One DLT of G3 QTcF prolongation occurred at 320 mg. No drug-related SAEs were reported. Drug-related AEs â‰¥ G2 included QTcF prolongation (2 G2, 2 G3), elevated lipase (1 G3), fatigue (4 G2), arthralgia (1 G2), diarrhea (1 G2), and platelet count decrease (1 G2). One pt on study had AR F877L at baseline and remained on treatment for 49 wks with PR by RECIST. The remaining 21 pts did not have AR F877L at baseline and of these, 48% (10) remained on study > 6 cycles and one pts had a > 50% decrease in PSA. Target PK exposures were achieved consistently at 280 mg. 280 mg was selected as the RP2D based on safety and PK data. Conclusions: TRC253 daily at 280 mg was well-tolerated and selected as the RP2D. P2 dose expansion is currently enrolling 2 cohorts: 15 pts with AR F877L and 30 pts without AR F877L. The objectives of P2 include collection of additional data for safety, PK, PET and efficacy of TRC253 in mCRPC pts with specific AR mutations. Clinical trial information: NCT02987829
