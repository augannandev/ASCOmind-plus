Our previous work has shown that radiomics or computer extracted texture features are associated with DS on multiparametric MRI (mpMRI). DS associated radiomics (RDS) may capture signatures related to poor prognosis of prostate cancer (PCa) following RP. Thus, we sought to evaluate whether RDS were also able to predict the risk of biochemical recurrence (BCR), a surrogate clinical endpoint of metastasis, after RP. Methods: Two patient cohorts from two institutions who underwent 3T mpMRI prior to RP were used in this study - I1: 70 PCa patients who had a Decipher test following RP; I2: 120 PCa patients with at least 5-year follow-up after RP. I1 was investigated as a training set to identify RDS and develop a multivariate logistic regression model (CL). I2 was used as a testing set to validate CL for predicting BCR. A total of 150 radiomics were extracted within each lesion from T2-weighted MRI (T2WI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and Kaplan-Meier (KM) analysis were used to evaluate performance of CL. Results: Radiomics quantifying lesion spot and ripple texture patterns on ADC maps and T2WI intensity gradient changes were able to differentiate Decipher high and low/intermediate groups in I1 (AUC = 0.92). The same model CL was then applied to I2 resulting in a significant difference in BCR-free survival time between the predicted risk groups (p < 0.05, hazard ratio (HR) = 2.54) independent of Gleason Grade Group (GGG, p < 0.05, HR = 7.61) and PIRADS-v2 (p < 0.05, HR = 5.64) in multivariate testing. Especially, for patients with GGG > 2 (n = 57), CL predicted BCR risk groups shown HR = 3.1 (p < 0.05) while GGG alone was not prognostic (p > 0.05, HR = 1.93). Conclusions: Our radiomic model was able to predict DS and was found to also be prognostic of BCR-free survival. Further work will involve evaluating whether these radiomic features are predictive of PCa metastasis. BCR-free survival analysis of radiomic model CL. Log-rank p-value and hazard ratio show that CL is prognostic of BCR-free survival. Predicted Risk group #Patients % BCR Median time to BCR (mon.)
