Real-life studies with broader selection criteria may help inform clinical practice. Methods: We reviewed the medical records of 1890 patients with prostate cancer seen at our institution between 01/07 and 07/18. We analyzed patients treated with long-acting leuprorelin acetate, grouping these patients into three strata according to the administration of ADT every 1, 3 or 6 months. The primary outcome was the prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels at 6 and 12 months after treatment initiation. We used Friedman test to compare the distribution of PSA levels over time within each treatment stratum, considering two-sided P values < 0.05 as statistically significant. Results: We analyzed a total of 932 eligible patients, with a median age of 72 years and a median time since diagnosis of prostate cancer of 8.5 months. ADT was administered every 1, 3 and 6 months in 115, 637, and 180 patients, respectively. Nearly half of the patients had locally advanced disease. The table presents PSA levels in each stratum at the three time points. Sexual impotence and hot flashes were the most frequently reported toxicities. Conclusions: Our study confirms that serum PSA levels can be effectively reduced, with a favorable toxicity profile, in most patients treated with long-acting leuprorelin acetate. Administration every 6 months may bring the added benefit of convenience and cost savings in clinical practice.
