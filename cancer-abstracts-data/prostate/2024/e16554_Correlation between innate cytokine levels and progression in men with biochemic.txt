Assessing longitudinal cytokine changes may shed light on mechanisms of disease progression, resistance to therapy, and suggest new therapeutic targets. Methods: Thirty-seven men with biochemically recurrent (BCR) prostate cancer who received 6 months of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and were monitored until the time of PSA progression (TTPP) were identified from a previously conducted phase III trial (NCT00020085). Serum samples were archived at baseline, three months after administration of ADT, and at TTPP. Cytokine concentrations were quantified using a 36-parameter electrochemiluminescence assay (MesoScale Discovery). Wilcoxon signed rank sum test was used to compare paired observations between time points. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to calculate progression function (TTPP) dichotomized by above or below the median value of cytokines with Bonferroni adjustment. Pearson’s rank correlation coefficient was used to compare continuous variables. Results: Median TTPP was 399 days (range, 114 - 1641). Median PSA at baseline and progression were 8.5 ng/ml, (range, 1.0 - 76.6) and 5.3 ng/mL (range, 1.2 - 19.4), respectively. Twenty-three patients (62%) achieved undetectable PSA with ADT. TNF-α (P = 0.002), IL-23 (P = 0.002), and IP-10 (P = 0.001) significantly increased from baseline to post ADT. Patients with a detectable PSA after ADT had moderately elevated levels of IL-6 (P = 0.049) and IL-8 (P = 0.013) at PSA progression as compared to those with an undetectable PSA. There was a trend toward shorter TTPP in patients with TNF-α levels above the median (P = 0.042). TNF-α was strongly correlated with IL-23 (r = 0.72, P < 0.001) and IL-8 (r = 0.59, P < 0.001) from baseline to after ADT and to PSA progression. NLR correlated strongly with IL-27 (r = 0.57, P < 0.001) and MIP-3α (r = 0.56, P < 0.001). Conclusions: Cytokines associated with the innate immune response were associated with an unfavorable clinical outcome in early prostate cancer. These data suggest cytokine blockade combined with ADT may warrant future investigation.
