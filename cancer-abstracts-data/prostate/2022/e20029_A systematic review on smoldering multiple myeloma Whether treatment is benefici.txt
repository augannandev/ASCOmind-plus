There are multiple early intervention strategies investigated in the last ten years, including single v/s combination therapy, which can either delay progression or be used as an aggressive therapy to cure SMM. This study aims to summarize the reported outcomes of interventions in SMM within the past decade. Methods: We performed a literature search following PRISMA guidelines and used the following bibliographic databases: PUBMED, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and clinical trials.gov. A total of 1474 articles were found from the above-mentioned databases and a total of seven articles were included in the final analysis. Results: Seven clinical trials were finalized, which included 599 patients, gender was specified in five studies and constituted 51 percent female patients, and the remaining were males. The median age of patients ranges from 61 (21-89) years. In progression evaluation, four studies, 440 patients were considered. However, significant heterogeneity existed with treatments and the survival analysis hence cumulative PFS was not obtained. PFS greater than 90% was obtained in two studies; 95.5% was obtained with Carfilzomib (K), lenalidomide (R), and dexamethasone(d) regimen after a follow-up period of 31.9 months. PFS of 91% was obtained with Lenalidomide alone for a follow-up of 35 months. Three studies, including 200 patients, were evaluated for response rate. MRD negative CR of 70.4% was obtained with the use of the KRd regimen. Overall response (ORR) of intense and intermediate use of Daratumumab showed a rate of 56.7% and 53.1%, while the complete response in the respective arms was 4.9% and 9.8%. CR, stringent CR of 17.4% and 4.3% was obtained with the use of Isatuximab with Lenalidomide. Conclusions: No definite conclusion can be made due to variability in the data. However, based on the data analyzed from the seven clinical trials, we advocate for early therapeutic intervention in high-risk SMM patients. There are multiple ongoing clinical trials to answer whether we should treat SMM or not.
