The median survival of this is group is less than 12 months so salvage therapies need to be implemented quickly. Real-world access to CAR T remains challenging due to supply chain limitations impacting manufacturing. The goal of this study was to evaluate how centers are handling the challenges of CAR T slot allocation. Methods: MM CAR T physician leaders at each CAR T treatment center certified for idecabtagene vicleucel across the US were surveyed. Results: We received responses from 15/20 centers. Summary of CAR T volumes and outcomes of patient on waitlists are shown in the table. The median time on the waiting list was 6 months with only 25% of patients receiving CAR T eventually. For patient selection, all centers reported using a committee of experienced CART physicians to ensure consistency. Selection committee included: primary MD (n=9), CAR T MD (n=12), social workers (n=3), CAR T RN (n=10), APP (n=2), pharmacists (n=2) and ethicists (n=1). To ensure transparency, centers have clear selection criteria (n=10), priority score (n=8) and selection timeline (n=11) . To ensure accountability, centers document priority scores (n=5) and have pre-specified criteria (n=9) for selection. Centers also reported using ethical principles for selection: a) equal treatment: time spent on waiting list (n=8); b) priority to the worst-off: limited therapeutic options (n=10), MM burden (n=7), ineligible for trials (n=2); c) maximize benefit: most likely to complete apheresis (n=8) or infusion (n=8) or achieve response (n=6) and d) social value: younger pts (n=2). Maximizing benefit was considered the most important criterion by 7 centers. Conclusions: More stringent GMP manufacturing requirements with FDA approved CAR T and real-world practice with broader patient demographics can present challenges to implementation of CAR T in standard of practice. Our study is the first attempt to evaluate and highlight existing issues with MM CAR T access and the variability and challenges in patient selection. Learning from other models of resource allocation (ex: UNOS) and sharing experience across centers can help providers optimize slot allocation to improve accrual. Increasing supplies of key reagents and novel manufacturing methods(eg: non-viral vectors and allogeneic CAR) could help overcome these limitations. CAR T volumes and outcomes.
