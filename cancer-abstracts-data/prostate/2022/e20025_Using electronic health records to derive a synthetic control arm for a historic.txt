Synthetic Control Arms (SCA) may reduce the time and cost of running a trial, and ultimately alleviate patient burden. This study explores the potential of SCAs derived from EHR to provide additional support for trials investigating treatment efficacy in multiple myeloma (MM). Methods: De-identified EHR from a UK NHS trust were matched with patients from a historical, Phase III randomised control trial investigating the efficacy of elotuzumab therapy in combination with lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone in relapsed/refractory MM (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01239797). Trial specific eligibility criteria were applied to the EHR dataset to derive 94 patients for the SCA. The primary outcome was progression free survival (PFS), as defined by the International Myeloma Working Group based on relative and absolute changes in serum M protein or kappa/lambda free light chain assay. The observation period was defined as time from randomisation (Trial) or treatment initiation (SCA) to death or disease progression. Results: In the SCA, the median age was 72 years [range 41, 93], 44% female, 76% white ethnicity, between 1 to 3 prior therapies, and between 0 to 6.3 years since diagnosis. This is in comparison to the trial control arm (n = 325) with a median age of 66 years [range 38, 91], 41% female, 86% white ethnicity, 1 to 4 prior therapies, and 0 to 16.2 years since diagnosis. Median PFS in the SCA was 14.4 months (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 9.5, 22.2), compared to 14.9 months (95% CI 12.1, 17.2) in the trial control arm. The hazards of progression or death in the trial treatment arm (when compared to trial control) was 0.70 (95% CI 0.57, 0.85) and 0.71 (95% CI 0.54, 0.95) when compared to the SCA. Additional sensitivity analysis using Multiple Imputation of missing ECOG values in the SCA yielded similar results, with a median PFS of 16.5 months (95% CI 10.4, 24.0) and hazards that is 0.77 (95% CI 0.57, 1.05) lower in the treatment arm. Conclusions: These results show that SCA can generate valuable additional evidence of efficacy supporting regulatory submission with considerable benefits in term of budget and time. Future work on SCAs aim to further refine the precision of estimates by applying the best performing confounder adjustment techniques.
