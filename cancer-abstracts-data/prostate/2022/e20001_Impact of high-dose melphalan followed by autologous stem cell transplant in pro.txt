Gertz Organizations Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN; Division of Hematopathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN; Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN Abstract Disclosures Research Funding No funding received Background: High dose melphalan followed by autologous stem cell transplant (HDM-ASCT) remains the standard of care for transplant-eligible patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) despite advances in treatments. Achievement of complete response (CR) is associated with improved overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS); Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) negativity (-) using next generation flow cytometry with a sensitivity of 10-5 is strongly associated with improved PFS and OS. We investigated the rates of conversion to MRD(-), especially MRD(-) CR following HDM-ASCT in patients with NDMM. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed patients with NDMM who underwent early HDM-ASCT at Mayo Clinic Rochester from May 2018 to July 2019. Response assessment was conducted after induction and within 100 days post-ASCT based on 2016 IMWG criteria, except for using Mass-Fix instead of immunofixation. MRD was assessed in bone marrow using the established Euro Flow protocol with sensitivity of 10-5. The FISH assay was used to risk-stratify patients as high-risk (HR) and standard risk (SR) cytogenetics as per the mSMART guidelines. Primary outcome measure was the conversion to MRD(-) CR after ASCT. Secondary outcomes include the overall conversion to MRD(-) irrespective of IMWG response, the impact of HR cytogenetics and pre-ASCT IMWG response on conversion to MRD(-) CR. Results: Two-hundred and ten patients were included; 126 (60%) were male and median age 62 years (range 32â€“77 years). There were 78 (44%) patients with HR cytogenetics. Pre-ASCT, 23 patients (11%) achieved MRD(-) CR, and 66 (31%) patients achieved MRD(-) CR post ASCT. Of 187 patients not in MRD(-) CR pre-ASCT, 45 (24%) converted to MRD(-) CR. Table provides a breakdown of the conversion rate of pre-ASCT IMWG response category to MRD(-) CR post ASCT and patients with MRD(+) CR had the highest rate (78%) of conversion. The presence of HR cytogenetics did not impact rates of MRD(-) CR achievement post ASCT irrespective of pre-ASCT IMWG response (p = 1.0). Overall, irrespective of IMWG response, 43 (20%) patients were MRD(-) pre-ASCT (19 in VGPR, 24 in CR or better) and 102 (49%) patients were MRD(-) post-ASCT (36 in VGPR, 66 in CR or better). Among 85 patients in VGPR post-ASCT, 36 were MRD(-) of which 8 (22%) progressed, while 49 were MRD(+) of which 24 (49%) progressed (p = 0.014). Conclusions: Upfront HDM-ASCT in patients with NDMM leads to deeper responses with 24% converting to MRD(-) CR and more than doubling of the total rate of MRD(-) irrespective of IMWG response. Percent conversion to MRD- CR post-ASCT by IMWG response achieved pre-ASCT.
