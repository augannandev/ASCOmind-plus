MM patients have heterogeneous outcomes that depend on several demographic, genetic and clinical factors. Here, we report the demographics along with the short and long-term outcomes in a cohort of patients who underwent Autologous Stem Cell Transplant (ASCT) over a period of 5 years. Methods: In this retrospective cohort, we assessed all MM patients who underwent ASCT at the Cleveland Clinic during the period between January 1, 2016 and January 15, 2021. Demographic characteristics, ISS staging, Cytogenetic risk categorization, Pre-ASCT treatment, short-term in-hospital complications, response (defined per IMWG response criteria) before and up to12 months after ASCT, as well as maintenance therapy were collected by reviewing electronic health records. Continuous variables are presented as mean with standard deviation, while categorical variables are presented as percentages. Categorical variables are compared using the chi-squared test while continuous variables are compared using the ANOVA and t-tests. Results: 379 patients who underwent ASCT within the studied time period were identified (Table). Most common cytogenetic abnormalities were del(13) (RB) 25.07%, t(11;14) 17.94% and gain(1q) 16.62%. A Lenalidomide, Bortezomib and dexamethasone (RVd) regimen was the most common to elicit response pre-ASCT (59.05%). Complete response (CR) was achieved in 27.82%, very good partial response (VGPR) in 34.71% and partial response (PR) in 37.47% of all patients pre-ASCT as compared to CR in 43.05%, VGPR in 28.05%, PR in 24.73% and progressive disease (PD) in 4.17% 3 months post-ASCT. All patients received intermediate (140 mg/m2) or high-dose (200 mg/m2) Melphalan conditioning. Average length of hospital stay was 14.56 Â± 2.11. Of all patients, thrombotic events were seen in 1.3%, bleeding in 1.8%, neuropathy in 5.34%, mucocutaneous toxicities in 47.99%, cytopenias in 98.39% and infections in 32.25%. RBC and platelet transfusions were required in 36.1% and 88.9% of patients, respectively. Progression-free survival (PFS) was 96.89% at 3 months, 93.77% at 6 months, 92.55% at 9 months, and 88.47% at 12 months post-ASCT. PFS up to 12 months was not statistically different across ISS stages (p = 0.881) or cytogenetic risk categories (p = 0.347). Most common cause of death was progressive MM (73.47%). Conclusions: Responses in MM are boosted by ASCT. Its most common complications are transfusion-dependent thrombocytopenia and infections. Most patients survive beyond 1 year with PD rate of only 11.53%. Advanced ISS stage and high-risk cytogenetics do not confer higher PD in the 1st 12 months post-ASCT. Median Age 62 [33-77] Gender Males 55.4%; Females 44.6% Ethnicity White 81%; Black 14.78% ISS Stage I 30.61% II 32.25% III 19.53% Cytogenetic Risk Standard 53.30% High 27.70%
