Standard treatment of multiple myeloma (MM) involves a combination of intravenous (IV) and oral therapies. The purpose of this study is to assess the impact COVID-19 had on IV and oral medication prescribing patterns pre and during the COVID-19 pandemic among MM patients. Methods: This is a retrospective review of adult MM patients insured by a large commercial and Medicare health plan in the United States who started a new IV or oral MM agent during the study period. To assess the impact of COVID-19 on IV and oral medication prescribing patterns, we compareda pre-COVID period (March 1-August 31, 2019) to a COVID period (March 1-August 31, 2020). We utilized medical and pharmacy claims to identify patients and calculated new therapy starts per newly diagnosed patient (defined as the number of patients starting a new IV or oral medication for MM divided by the total number of patients with a first indication date of MM within the study timeframe). We compared rates using a Chi-square test; p-values â‰¤ 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results: 1,754 patients were enrolled in the study; there were no significant differences in demographic characteristics pre and during COVID-19 between the two groups with respect to age (67.05 vs. 66.64; p=0.45), gender (p=0.80), insurance plan type (p=0.17), geographical region (p=0.26) and medication (p=0.59). During COVID-19, the number of newly diagnosed MM patients decreased by 22% (9,657 to 7,560) and the total number of new therapy starts decreased by 11% (930 to 824). When looking at rates of new therapy starts per newly diagnosed patient, both IV (11%; p=0.03) and oral (51%; p=0.03) medication rates significantly increased. Additionally, there were significant increases in new therapy start rates by region in the Northeast for oral (157%; p<0.01) and West for IV (32%; p=0.02) medications. There were no significant differences in new start rates by insurance plan type (all p>0.08). Conclusions: While the total count of new therapy starts, a proxy for new diagnoses, decreased during COVID-19, the rate of new starts for both IV and oral therapies for patients diagnosed with MM significantly increased. These increased start rates may be explained by a remarkable 22% drop in the total number of newly diagnosed MM patients during COVID-19. As the pandemic continues, further study is warranted to understand how COVID-19 may impact IV vs. oral usage in MM. Patient demographics.
