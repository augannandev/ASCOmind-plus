There are mixed trial results for antibacterial prophylaxis to reduce infection risk in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and its use remains controversial. Methods: To evaluate the incidence of bacterial infection and early mortality in patients receiving bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (RVD) for NDMM, we performed a retrospective single-center cohort study of patients treated between 01/2014-01/2020. Demographic and clinical data were collected. Two cohorts were generated for those patients with or without bacterial infection during the follow-up period. A multivariate logistic regression was utilized to determine risk factors for bacterial infection. Variables with a P-value <0.2 on univariate analysis were considered for the model. For co-linear variables with a P-value <0.2 on univariate analysis, only one variable was included in the multivariable model. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was generated to assess the sensitivity and specificity of the model. Results: Of 144 patients, 21 patients (14.5%) experienced a bacterial infection of any grade. 11% of patients received pneumocystis prophylaxis, and 1 patient received levofloxacin prophylaxis. 11 (7.6%) patients experienced grade 3 (G3) or higher infection. One patient died in our cohort; there were no deaths from infection. G3 neutropenia occurred in 11% of patients with 2% experiencing any grade febrile neutropenia. Pneumonia and urinary tract infections were common, affecting 8(5.5%) and 6 (4.2%) patients, respectively. On multivariable analysis (Table), age, smoking history, history of diabetes, antibiotic use in the 60 days preceding 1st cycle of RVD, and high-risk cytogenetics (HR CG) were associated with a greater likelihood of experiencing a bacterial infection. The area under the ROC curve of the multivariable model was 0.829 (95% CI 0.729-0.934). Conclusions: The overall incidence of bacterial infection in NDMM patients receiving induction with RVD was low despite minimal use of antibacterial prophylaxis. Early mortality was uncommon and not attributable to infection. Clinical features may identify a subgroup of patients at greater risk of infection during induction therapy for MM and may impact clinical decisions to utilize antibacterial prophylaxis.
