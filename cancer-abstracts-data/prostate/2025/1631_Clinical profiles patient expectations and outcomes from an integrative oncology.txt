There is paucity of data regarding Integrated oncology model approach combining alternate systems of medicines like Ayurveda & Siddha, Yoga and Dietary modification recommendations along with SoC . In this study, we present an audit of this novel Integrated oncology model of care provided by online and in-patient consultations at Isha Integrative Oncology Clinic (IIOC), Isha Health Solutions (IH), Coimbatore, India. Methods: A clinical audit was conducted for 514 patients who have received care through Integrated oncology consultations ( in-person or online) at IIOC from January 2016 to July 2024. This abstract focuses on the statistical analysis of data of the initial 196 consecutive patients based on descriptive data from clinical proformas and follow-up visits for symptomatic response outcomes. Updated data will be presented at the conference. Results: Among 196 patients analysed, 99% of patients had online consultations. The median age was 52yrs (7-81yrs) and Male: Female ratio was 1: 1.3. 50% belonged to age group 40-60 yrs whereas 29% were between 60-85 yrs. Most common cancers in males were hematological cancers (20%), prostate cancers (11%), GI cancers (11%) and in females were breast (26%), ovary (10%) and colon (5%). The most common stage was Stage 4 (58%) followed by Stage 3 (40%). Most common symptoms were pain (49%), anorexia (43%), fatigue (42%), lack of sleep and anxiety (39%). Most common side effects of chemotherapy were fatigue (32%), constipation (25%), anorexia/weight loss (25%), pain (16%) etc. Most common expectations were cure/avoid relapse (32%), symptomatic relief (15%), reduction from chemotherapy side effects (11%), integration of Yoga (10%) etc. Only 6% of patients wished to avoid chemotherapy. Integrated oncology model based on complementary systems of medicine (Ayurveda & Siddha), dietary changes and yoga was provided to all patients (100%). After using this model of care, improvement in cancer-related symptoms was reported by 90% of patients and compliance seen in 73% of patients. Conclusions: Our study is one of the largest clinical audits in Integrative oncology in published literature. Younger patients and advanced cancer patients more often seek integrative oncology care and main expectation is to achieve better cure rates and symptomatic relief. In this study, all patients were provided a novel integrated oncology model with alternative medicines (Ayurveda & Siddha), yoga, and dietary modifications in addition to their ongoing SoC resulting in good symptomatic relief and high compliance rates. Integrative oncology model incorporating alternative medicine, yoga, and dietary changes can be effectively offered to cancer patients alongside standard treatment. Further prospective studies are warranted.
