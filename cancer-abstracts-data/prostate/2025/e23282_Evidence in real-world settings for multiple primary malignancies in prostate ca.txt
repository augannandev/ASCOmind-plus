Patients under this condition pose a challenge for the sociosanitary system, as they require specific anticancer treatment strategies and cancer care. Cancer Registries (CRs) are postulated as enablers of evidence-driven care, shedding light on the theory-practice gap. The objective of this study was to address differences in real-world settings between patients diagnosed with prostate single primary tumors (SPT) and patients diagnosed with MPMs. Methods: Data of 2555 patients diagnosed with prostate cancer at a single institution from 2008 to 2018 was collected from the CR, 2431 (95,15%) diagnosed with SPT and 124 (4,85%) diagnosed with prostate as one of the MPMs. The classification of MPMs was done under the definition of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). Relapse-free survival (RFS), metastasis-free survival (MFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. A significance threshold of α < 0,05 was established. Results: In the overall population, median diagnosis age of 70 (Q1 65; Q3 74) years and a median PSA value of 8 (Q1 6; Q3 12) was observed. Tumors of stage II, differentiation grade of 2 and Gleason lower than 7 were the most common. Stage III tumors were more frequent on SPTs than on MPMs (p = 0,015), but no statistical difference is found regarding risk tumor categorization. Non-basocellular skin cancer, bladder, colon, rectum, bronchus and lung, kidney and stomach were among the most common other primary tumors. From the 124 MPMs, 101 (81,45%) were classified as metachronous and 23 (18,55%) as synchronous. The 5-year OS was 89,58 (95% CI 88,21-90,79) for SPTs versus 74,76 (95% CI 66,23-81,43) for MPMs (p < 0,001). Significant difference in OS was observed for bladder (p = 0,047), colon (p = 0,004), kidney (p < 0,001), rectum (p = 0,044) and stomach (p = 0,017) combined with prostate MPMs over SPTs. MFS at 5 years was 95,33 (95% CI 94,34-96,15) for SPTs and 91,44 (95% CI 84,66-95,31) for MPMs (p = 0,044). Difference in MFS was statistically significant for colon-prostate (p = 0,002) and prostate-kidney (p < 0,001) MPMs over SPTs. The 5-year RFS was 80,33 (95% CI 78,57-81,96) for SPTs and 84,35 (95% CI 76,27-89,86) for MPMs (p = 0,3099). Conclusions: Patients diagnosed with MPMs show significantly worse outcomes than patients diagnosed with prostate SPT. However, no difference is found regarding prostate tumor risk classification. MPMs such as prostate-kidney and stomach-prostate tend to have lower MFS and OS rates. Further analysis on a higher sample is required to study significant long-term outcomes. CRs arise as a strong asset to bridge the evidence gap in the study of MPMs.
