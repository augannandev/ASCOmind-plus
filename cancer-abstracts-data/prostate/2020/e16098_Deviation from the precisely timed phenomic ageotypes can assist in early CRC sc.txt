We hypothesized that deep phenomic profiling of longitudinal sera would allow the identification of distinct phenomic chronologic patterns as a normal biological clock baseline to study personal aging. We further hypothesized that molecular assessment of this chronologic deviation, due to advance adenoma and early CRC, from the normal reference ageotypes would be instrumental as potential early diagnostics and reveal underlying pathophysiology. Methods: A cohort of 7673 normal, 746 advanced adenoma, 1177 stage I, 103 stage II and 119 stage III blood samples were assembled. Innovative multi-omics approaches, with global and targeted LCMS data production (metabolomics, lipidomics, and 2D proteomics), were applied to deep profile these subjects. Identification of the age-associated molecular patterns in normal subjects, modeled with an elastic net algorithm, established the reference baseline to mirror a biological clock. CRC associated deviation from this chronologically paced multi-omics clock was quantified to screen for early CRCs and explore the underlying pathophysiology. Results: Multiple mProbe aging indices of proteins and metabolites were identified, strongly predicting chronologic age (P< 0.001, R > 0.90). Significant disruptions from normal molecular patterns were observed in advanced adenoma and early CRCs patients (R < 0.7). Pathway analysis of the proteins/metabolites with deviating patterns revealed both known and new pathways underlying CRC. Unsupervised cluster analysis identified unique aging subgroups among advanced adenoma and different stage CRC patients, indicating unique underlying biology relating to aging with different severities of cancer burdens. Conclusions: Deviations from the meticulously timed phenomic aging patterns may provide utility to allow future early CRC screening. Close examination of the underlying pathophysiology associated with early CRC, relating to ageotypes, not only may improve the sensitivity and specificity of prognostic and diagnostic tests of early CRCs, but also shed new insights into CRC therapeutics.
