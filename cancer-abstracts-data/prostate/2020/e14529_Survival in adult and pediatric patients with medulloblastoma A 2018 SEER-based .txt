Background: Medulloblastoma (MB) is a malignant neuroectodermal tumor accounting for 30% of pediatric and only 1% of adult brain tumors. In previous studies comparing survival in pediatric and adult MB from the National Cancer Institute Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database no difference has been found. However, diagnostic subgroup analyses have been limited. Methods: We examined survival in children (age 0-19) and adults (20-79) coded as MB in the 2018 SEER database (2000-2016). We used Kaplan Meier analysis, log-rank test and Cox proportional hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). MB in SEER-18 is defined as ICD-O-3 histology codes 9470–9474 (n = 1,728). ICD 9473, supratentorial PNET (sPNET, n = 97) is biologically distinct and therefore it was analyzed separately. Results: We found that 5-year survival for MB, excluding sPNET, was similar in children (n = 1,091, 75.3%) and adults (n = 488, 79.1%) (HR = 0.97, CI: 0.79 – 1.17, p = 0.50). Furthermore, subtype analyses showed no survival difference comparing adults and children with desmoplastic nodular MB (n = 222, p = 0.09), large cell MB (n = 73, p = 0.46), or MB NOS (n = 1330, p = 0.10). Yet, children with sPNET had improved 5-year survival (n = 65, 72.3%) compared to adults (n = 29, 51.7%) (HR = 2.0, CI: 1.10 – 3.92; p = 0.02,). These findings indicate that while survival in patients with MB is similar across age groups, children with sPNET have improved outcomes. Conclusions: In summary, 2018 SEER data for MB continue to show no survival difference between adults and children, suggesting adult patients could appropriately be entered on pediatric MB treatment protocols. Further analyses of the 2018 data are ongoing adjusting for sex, race, and treatment (chemotherapy or radiation). For sPNET, the apparent improved outcomes for children merit further detailed investigation and will be re-evaluated using the new 2016 World Health Organization classification.
