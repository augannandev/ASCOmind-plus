Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) is the rate limiting enzyme of 5-FU catabolic pathway. Thymidylate synthase (TS) is the target of 5-FU anti-tumor mechanism. Several studies have shown the up-regulation of the two enzymes after the use of 5-FU in colorectal cancer, which may be closely related to the 5-FU resistance. The preliminary research of our center has shown the efficacy and safety of S-1 (containing a DPD inhibitor) plus raltitrexed (a TS inhibitor) in refractory mCRC. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab plus S-1 and raltitrexed for patients with mCRC after failure to fluoropyrimidine, irinotecan and oxaliplatin. Methods: This study is a one-center, single-arm, prospective phase II trial, being carried out in the Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, China. The patients who have progressed after the treatment of fluoropyrimidine, irinotecanand oxaliplatin, have at least one measurable lesion according to RECIST 1.1 criteria were enrolled. Patients receive bevacizumab 7.5mg/kg and raltitrexed 3 mg/m2 on days 1 plus S-1 80, 100 or 120 mg/d according to body-surface area on days 1 through 14 of a 21-day cycle. Primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and toxicity. Results: From Sep 2015 to Nov 2019, 44 patients were enrolled. By Feb 5, 2020, eleven patients were alive. Tumor response evaluation was available in 44 patients at the time of the analysis. There was no complete response, ORR was 15.9%(7/14) and disease control rate was 54.5%(24/44). mPFS and mOS were 110 days (95% confidence interval, 65.0-155.0) and 367 days (95% confidence interval, 310.4-423.6). The most common adverse events were bone marrow depression, dysfunction of digestive system abnormality of liver function and bleeding. Most of these adverse events were mild to moderate. Conclusions: Bevacizumab plus S-1 and raltitrexed further showed its moderate effect for refractory mCRC. Most of the adverse effects were mild to moderate, which could be well controlled. This combined regimen is worthy of further study as third or later line therapy in mCRC. Clinical trial information: ChiCTR1900020485.
