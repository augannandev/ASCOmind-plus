Methods: We retrospectively evaluated the patients who underwent curative surgery for non-metastatic CRC between 2006 and 2017. The potential prognostic value of De Ritis ratio was assessed by using a ROC curve analysis. The effect of the De Ritis ratio was analyzed by the Kaplan–Meier method and Cox regression hazard models for patients’ disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Results: We had 921 CRC patients in total. The univariate analysis demonstrated that low De-Ritis ratio and several well-established prognostic factors, including well-differentiated tumor,negative lymph node involvement, lymphatic invasion, perineural invasion and surgical margin, left tumor localization and early-stage tumor were good prognostic factors in terms of DFS and OS. On the multivariate analysis, De-Ritis ratio, lymph node involvement, perineural invasion status, surgical margin statusand tumor localization were independent prognostic factors for DFS [De-Ritis ratio HR 0.468, 95% CI 0.358-0.613,p < 0.001]. We also found that De-Ritis ratio, degree of differentiation, lymphatic invasion status, perineural invasion statusand stage were independent prognostic factors for OS on multivariate analysis [De-Ritis ratio HR 0.354, 95% CI 0.407-0.702, p < 0.001]. Conclusions: Our study first established a connection between the preoperative De-Ritis ratio and patients undergoing curative resection for non-metastatic colorectal cancer, suggesting that De-Ritis ratio was a simple, inexpensive, and easily measurable marker as a prognostic factor and may help to identify high-risk patients for treatment decisions.
