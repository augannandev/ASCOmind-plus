We aimed to develop a support vector machine (SVM) classifier utilising combined longitudinal conventional and Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast (DSC) perfusion MRI to classify between Stable Disease (SD), Pseudoprogression (PsP) and Progressive Disease (PD) in glioma patients under surveillance. Methods: Conventional (269) and perfusion (62) MRI studies of HGG patients acquired between 2012 and 2018 were prospectively analysed. Study participants were separated into two groups: Group I with a single DSC time point (64 participants) and Group II with multiple DSC time points (19 participants). The SVM classifier was trained using all available MRI for each group. Classification accuracy was assessed for the use of features extracted from different feature dataset and time point combinations and compared to the experienced radiologists’ predictions. Results: The study included 64 participants (mean age: 48.5 ± 12.8 yrs [standard deviation], 24 female). SVM classification based on combined perfusion and structural features outperformed standalone datasets across all groups. For the clinically relevant classification step (SD/PSP vs PD), both feature combination as well as the addition of multiple DSC time points, improved classification performance (lowest median error rate: 0.016). The SVM algorithm outperformed radiologists in predicting lesion destiny in both groups. Optimal performance was observed in Group II, in which SVM sensitivity/specificity/accuracy was 100/91.67/94.7% for analysis based on the first time point and 85.71/100/ 94.7% based on multiple time points compared to 60/78/68% and 70/90/84.2% for the respective radiologist classifications. In Group I, the SVM also exceeded radiologist predictions, albeit by a smaller margin and resulted in sensitivity/specificity of 86.49/75.00/81.53% (SVM) compared to 75.7/68.9/73.84% (radiologists). Conclusions: Our results indicate that the addition of multiple longitudinal perfusion time points as well as the combination of structural and perfusion features significantly enhance classification outcome in treatment monitoring of HGGs and machine-learning-assisted diagnosis has potentially superior accuracy than the radiologist's visual evaluation and expertise.
