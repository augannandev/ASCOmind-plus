Nanoliposomes improve the solubility and bioavailability of drugs and potentially increase their ability to cross the blood brain barrier. We performed a phase I study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and preliminary efficacy of nal-IRI in combination with metronomic temozolomide (TMZ) in patients with recurrent glioblastoma. Methods: Patients with recurrent glioblastoma who had progressed after at least 1 line of therapy with a KPS of > 60 were eligible. All patients received TMZ 50 mg/m2 PO daily with nal-IRI IV every 2 weeks until disease progression. Three dose levels of nal-IRI were planned, 50 mg/m2, 70 mg/m2 and 80 mg/m2. Dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) were defined as those occurring during the first 2 cycles (28 days) of treatment. Patients were accrued in a 3+3 design. Accrual at the MTD level was to be expanded to 25 patients, unless the study was terminated early if 0-1 responses were observed in the first 13 evaluable patients. Results: Twelve patients were treated over 2 dose levels (nal-IRI 50-70 mg/m2). At dose level 2, nal-IRI 70mg/m2, 2 of 3 patients developed DLTs, including one patient who developed grade 4 neutropenia, grade 2 diarrhea and grade 3 anorexia and one patient with grade 3 diarrhea, grade 3 hypokalemia and grade 3 anorexia. Accrual at nal-IRI 50 mg/m2, defined as the MTD, was expanded to 9 patients. Treatment-related toxicities at this dose level included grade 3 ALT (N = 1). As there were no responses seen in the initial 12 patients (0/12, 0%), the BrUOG Data Safety Monitoring Board terminated the study. Conclusions: The MTD of nal-IRI was 50 mg/m2 every 2 weeks with TMZ 50mg/m2/day. DLTs were grade 3 diarrhea and anorexia. No antitumor activity was seen in the first 12 patients and the study was terminated. Clinical trial information: NCT03119064
