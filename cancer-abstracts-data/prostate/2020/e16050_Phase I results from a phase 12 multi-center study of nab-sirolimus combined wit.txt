Title: Phase I results from a phase 1/2 multi-center study of nab-sirolimus combined with mFOLFOX6+bevacizumab (FB) as first-line (1L) therapy in patients (pts) with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) with or without PTEN loss.

A recent phase 1/2 study in mCRC pts showed evidence that everolimus added to 1L SOC treatment improved outcomes, in particular in pts with PTEN loss (Gilcrease, 2019). This prospective, single-arm phase 1/2 study aims to identify the optimal dose and schedule of nab-sirolimus (ABI-009), an mTOR inhibitor, plus FB and evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of this regimen. Methods: Eligible pts have no prior therapy, â‰¥18 years old, ECOG performance status of 0-2. PTEN loss (by IHC) is evaluated for all pts. nab-Sirolimus IV starting dose and schedule was 30mg/m2 weekly for 3 weeks followed by a week of rest (on D1, 8, and 15 in a 28-day cycle, qw3/4) plus standard doses of FB on D1 and D15. Dose escalation to 45 and 60mg/m2 or de-escalation to 20 and 10mg/m2 followed the 3+3 design. Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) was assessed in cycle 1. Results: As of Jan 31, 2020, 24 pts were treated in the phase 1 study and 18 were evaluable for response . No DLTs were observed in the first 3 pts treated with nab-sirolimus at 30mg/m2 qw3/4; however, all 3 pts missed D8 doses (due to G2 thrombocytopenia and G3 neutropenia) and the cohort expanded to additional 3 pts for further observation. 5/6 pts missed D8 doses and a new dose cohort enrolled pts at 20mg/m2 qw3/4. No DLTs were observed and the cohort was expanded to 10 pts. A safety review of the first 18 pts observed that 9/18 pts missed doses on D8 and a new cohort was added to enroll pts at 20 mg/m2 q2w (D1 and D15, as for FB). This cohort enrolled 8 pts with no DLTs and represents the recommended-phase-2-dose (RP2D) and continues enrollment in phase 2. For all pts, 15/24 (63%) pts had G3-4 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs); most common were neutropenia (6/24, 25%) and thrombocytopenia (4/24, 17%). At the RP2D 3/8 (38%) pts had G3-4 TRAEs (thrombocytopenia, weight loss, and hypertension, 1 pt each). Among 18 evaluable pts, best response was: 7/18 (39%) partial response, 10/18 (56%) stable disease, and 16/18 (89%) had tumor shrinkage. PTEN was assessed in 14 pts: 4/14 (29%) had PTEN loss, 2/4 (50%) PTEN loss pts responded, while 3/10 (30%) pts that were PTEN+ (WT) had a response. Conclusions: The RP2D of nab-sirolimus is 20mg/m2 q2w in combination with standard mFOLFOX+bevacizumab. The phase 2 portion of the study is ongoing. Clinical trial information: NCT03439462.
