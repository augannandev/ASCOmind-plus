An overall survival of 23 months was a substantial improvement over historical experience. Patients with m-MGMT v. unmethylated tumors had a 2-yr survival of 75% and median survival not reached compared to 20% and 12.5 months, respectively. These data formed the basis for NOA-9, a randomized phase III trial in newly diagnosed, m-MGMT GBM which randomized 141 patients to standard therapy or experimental therapy with Lomustine and TMZ every 6 weeks. A superiority for the combination was observed: 48.1 v. 31.4 months for the standard arm in the ITT analysis. Nevertheless, many neurooncologists are reluctant to adopt this approach. The current standard of care uses single biomarker, m-MGMT, in contrast to comprehensive pathway analysis (CPA). We sought to determine if CPA could discriminate more effectively among each patient’s likelihood of benefiting from combination treatment. Methods: Cellworks Singula employs a novel Cellworks Omics Biology Model (CBM) to predict patient-specific biomarker and phenotype response of personalized GBM avatars to drug agents, radiation, and targeted therapies. The CBM was developed and validated using PubMed to generate protein network maps of patient-specific activated and inactivated disease pathways. CBM was used to simulate the TMZ and TMZ-Lomustine therapies for each patient in a TCGA cohort of 368 GBM patients. Omics data including methylation, whole exome sequencing, and copy number alterations were input into CBM. The Singula Composite Inhibition Score (CIS) was calculated based on the measured quantitative drug effects. Results: Though incremental gain from the combination was seen in all patients, CIS varied across the population with relative scores ranging from 32-82, with best responders have more than twice the benefit. Conclusions: CPA shows that m-MGMT is an excellent biomarker for determining the likelihood of benefit from TMZ and lomustine, with the caveat that CBM identifies 18% could be spared from TMZ exposure and would benefit from Lomustine alone. Otherwise, these data lend support for evolving the standard of care with combination therapy for patients with m-MGMT GBM and should help overcome a reluctance to employing combination therapy. Additionally, CBM has utility to individualize clinical decision making. CBM predicted benefit. m-MGMT Lomustine (%) TMZ (%) TMZ + Lomustine (%) Patients 78/368 78 (100) 64 (82) 78 (100)
