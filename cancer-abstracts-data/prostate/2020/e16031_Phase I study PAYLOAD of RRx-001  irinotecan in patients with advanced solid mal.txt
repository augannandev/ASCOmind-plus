Recently, RRx-001 has been shown to downregulate PD-L1 on circulating tumor cells. This phase 1 trial named PAYLOAD (NCT02801097) was performed to assess the safety and tolerability of the combination of RRx-001 and irinotecan and to determine a recommended phase II dose (RP2D). Methods: Eligible patients (pts) had adequate organ and bone marrow functions and an ECOG of 0-2 and evaluable refractory advanced solid tumors. RRx-001 was administered once per week for 3 weeks and thereafter once every two weeks. RRx-001 was administered as a 10-15 min IV infusion with irinotecan, which began on Week 4 and which was also given every other week, staggered with RRx-001 . Dose escalation followed a standard 3 + 3 design with co-escalation of RRx-001 and irinotecan as follows: 1: Irinotecan 120 mg/m2 + RRx-001, 0.5 mg 2: Irinotecan 120 mg/m2 + RRx-001, 2 mg 3: Irinotecan 120 mg/m2 + RRx-001, 4 mg 4: Irinotecan 150 mg/m2 + RRx-001, 4 mg Radiological imaging was performed every 8 weeks. Results: 12 pts; 1 gallbladder, 1 ampullary carcinoma, 1 cholangiocarcinoma, 5 colon, 1 GE junction, 2 pancreatic and 2 rectal cancers were enrolled from January 2018 to November 2018. 1 and 18 doses (median: 6 doses) of the combination of RRx-001 and irinotecan were received. The median number of prior treatments was 4 (range 1-5). There were 2 Grade 3 events, leukopenia and anemia, judged not related to RRx-001 but related to irinotecan, 1 Grade 4 event, leukopenia, judged not related to RRx-001 but related to irinotecan and 1 Grade 5 event, neutropenic enterocolitis, also judged not related to RRx-001 but related to irinotecan. No dose-limiting toxicities were identified. The median overall survival was ~ 6.5 months. Conclusions: Alternating weekly infusions of 150 mg/m2 of irinotecan and 4 mg of RRx-001 were well tolerated. No Grade 2 or above diarrhea was observed with irinotecan treatment, which suggests that RRx-001 may protect against gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities, since RRx-001 has also demonstrated anti- oral mucositis and anti-diarrheal properties in other studies.This dose level is the recommended phase 2 dose for future trials. Clinical trial information: NCT02801097.
