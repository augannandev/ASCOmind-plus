However the influence of surgical resections of metastases has not yet been quantified especially after 2003 when were attributed to the inclusion of MA (Kopetz et al 2009). We hypothesized the impact of metastatectomy rate (MR) in the OS of a population without MA and their influence on primary tumor location. Methods: Data from 291 consecutive patients diagnosed with mCRC treated in a clinical center in Brazil, from 2003 to 2019, without MA. 1° location was determined by chart review: R-sided = cecum to hepatic flexure; L-sided = splenic flexure to rectum. Pts with transverse tumors were excluded. Survival from diagnosis was calculated via kaplan-Meier and compare between the right and the left side has estimated via Cox Regression. Results: 50.85%(148) of patients had a primary tumor in the left colon. Oxaliplatin was used in 1° line in 85 % and irinotecan in 75% in 2° line, most of the metastasis was metachronous, only to a single-organ (50,9% liver, 18% lung) and 40 % underwent resection at the diagnosis. The overall survival for the entire cohort was 34.1 months (95% CI, 28.9 to 45.4 months) with 39 % MR. Sidedness (R vs L) had interaction with resected and non-resected metastasis p < 0.001). See OS Table results by sidedness below. Conclusions: It was possible to infer that the metastasectomy rate still have a significant and isolated benefit in the OS of this cohort without the use of MA, regardless of the mutational status of the tumors, being influenced by the sidedness of the primary tumor in the analyzed outcomes.
