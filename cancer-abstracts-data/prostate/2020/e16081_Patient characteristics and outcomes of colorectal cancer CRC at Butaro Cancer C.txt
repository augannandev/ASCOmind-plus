BCCOE in Rwanda provides patients with CRC access to chemotherapy, surgery and radiotherapy referrals. Here, we describe patient characteristics, treatments delivered and outcomes. Methods: This retrospective observational study included 136 patients with CRC who presented between July 2012 and June 2018. We abstracted patient characteristics, diagnostic and treatment data, and outcomes from electronic and paper records. We compared baseline and treatment characteristics for colon cancer (CC) versus (vs.) rectal cancer (RC) patients. For patients treated with curative intent, we plotted Kaplan Meier estimation of disease free survival (DFS), defined as time from presentation to cancer recurrence, progression or death. Log-rank test was used to examine subgroup differences. Results: The mean age was 52.5, and 71 (52.2%) were female. 101 (74.2%) patients had RC. Compared to CC, patients with RC were older 54.5 vs. 46.9 (p = 0.0084), and more likely female 59.4 vs. 31.4 (p = 0.0043). All provinces in Rwanda were represented including 14 (10.3%) from outside Rwanda; 79 (58.1%) patients lived in rural areas. Median duration of symptoms prior to presentation was 12 months, and 57 (41.9%) had used traditional medicine prior to presentation. 72 (52.9%) patients were non-metastatic, 46 (33.8%) de novo metastatic, 4 (2.9%) recurrent, and 14 (10.2%) had indeterminate stage. Of the patients treated with curative intent, 54 (65.1%) had neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant chemotherapy, while only 34 (41.0%) had curative surgery. 40 (48.2%) patients received a permanent colostomy. 18 (27.7%) patients with RC received concurrent chemoradiation. Over the follow up period, 49 (36%) patients died or were referred for end of life care, 13 (9.3%) remain in surveillance, while 65 (47.8%) were lost to follow up. Median DFS for patients with non-metastatic disease was 22.2 months. On exploratory analyses, there were no statistically significant differences in DFS by cancer type, gender, or performance status, though these analyses were underpowered and follow-up short. Conclusions: CRC treatment requires multidisciplinary care, which is a challenge in low-resource settings. Our results highlight gaps in CRC care delivery and suboptimal patient outcomes; most striking gaps were the low rates of surgery and radiation, and high loss to follow up rates. Rigorous research is needed to understand the underlying causes, and to develop interventions to address these gaps.
