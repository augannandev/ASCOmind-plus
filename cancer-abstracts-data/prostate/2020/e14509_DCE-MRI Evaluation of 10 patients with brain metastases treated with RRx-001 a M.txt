Methods: Ten patients with 64 total lesions evaluable at baseline, 24 hours, and end of radiotherapy (RT) that participated in BRAINSTORM were subjected to a correlative dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) examination four days prior to the start of whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) that evaluated Ktrans (capillary permeability) and Vp (plasma volume). The treatment comprised RRx-001 on Day -4, pre-WBRT then twice weekly during WBRT. Four dose levels were administered (5 mg/m2, 8.4 mg/m2, 16.5 mg/m2, and 27.5 mg/m2. Results: 10 patients underwent DCE-MRI scans and eight patients with 44 total evaluable lesions had available imaging at 1 month, and 6 patients with 29 total evaluable lesions had imaging at 4 months. On univariate analysis, only a decrease in 24-hour Vp from baseline after a single dose of RRx-001 was marginally associated with absolute tumor volume response 1 month after treatment (p-0.07). In a multivariate model, only Vp prior to therapy and 24-hour change in Vp were retained in the model after stepwise selection. A reduction in Vp 24 hours after RRx-001 (prior to WBRT) was associated with reduced tumor volume at 1 month (Estimate 0.88, 95% CI 0.37-1.40, p = 0.001) and 4 months (Estimate 1.51, 95% CI 0.58-2.43, p = 0.003). Likewise, a lower Vp prior to therapy was associated with reduced tumor volume at 1 month (Estimate 0.73, 95% CI 0.29-1.17, p = 0.002) and 4 months (Estimate 1.8, 95% CI 0.95-2.65, p = 0.0002), suggesting anti-angiogenic activity and early potential vascular normalization after a single dose of RRx-001 predictive of longer-term tumor response. Conclusions: RRx-001 induced a reduction in blood plasma volume, which was associated with tumor response and which suggests a vascular normalizing effect that merits further investigation in future planned studies.
