Full Abstract:
Authors person Snegha Ananth University of Texas Health at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX info_outline Snegha Ananth, Michelle Janania Martinez, Juan Garza, Prathibha Surapaneni, Tyler William Snedden, David Gregorio, Sushanth Kakarla, Jeremy Rawlings, Joel Michalek, Qianqian Liu, Adolfo Enrique Diaz Duque Organizations University of Texas Health at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX; University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX; UTHSCSA, San Antonio, TX Abstract Disclosures Research Funding No funding received None Background: Primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL) is a rare malignancy, comprising only 2% of primary CNS tumors in the United States.While it’s incidence has decreased in the immunocompromised population (HIV positive) secondary to widespread access of effective anti-retroviral therapy, it is suspected that the rates are increasing among immunocompetent people aged 65+ years at a rate of approximately 1.7% per year. Data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) looking into survival and incidence patterns in PCNSL have a majority of non-Hispanic (NH) white population with lesser proportion of other ethnicities. Understanding racial and ethnic disparities on outcomes and patterns of care are crucial given the rapid growth of the Hispanic (HI) population in the US. Therefore, our study aims to compare survival outcomes and contributing factors in HI vs NH with PCNSL, who were treated at the only NCI designated Cancer Center in South Texas. Methods: This is a retrospective study, where we identified patients who were diagnosed and treated for PCNSL at UT Health San Antonio, between January 2008 and December 2018. The patient characteristics, treatment patterns, and clinical outcomes were listed as descriptive statistics. Results: From 2008-2018, a total of 29 patients with PCNSL were included. Among those, 62% were HI(Hispanic) and the remaining 38% were NH(Non-Hispanic). The median age at diagnosis was 61 years (58 years in HI and 70 years in NH). 55% were below 65 years and 45% were older than 65 years. Everyone received chemotherapy (89% received R-MPV (DeAngelis protocol) and 9% received other high dose methotrexate containing regimens). However, in terms of receiving Whole Brain Radiation Therapy (WBRT), the patients in the younger group were more likely to receive it than were those in the elderly group (68% versus 23% respectively). Overall Survival (OS) rate at 3 years was 41 % in HI and 33 % in NH (p = 0.08) and at 5 years was 41 % in HI and 25 % in NH (p = 0.03). Conclusions: While there is increasing data on higher incidence of non-HIV PCNSL in elderly population > 65 years, HI in our study population had a significantly lower median age at diagnosis with better survival and outcomes. Further studies on a larger patient population may help to describe the differences in incidence, tumor biology, genetics and outcomes in HI population.
