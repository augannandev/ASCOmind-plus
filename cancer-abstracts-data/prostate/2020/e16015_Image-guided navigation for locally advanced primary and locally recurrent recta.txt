Therefore, an intraoperative surgical navigation system has been developed, showing improved radical resection rates for LARC and LRRC. This study evaluates the early cost-effectiveness of navigated surgery in LARC and LRRC compared to standard surgery. Methods: Two Markov decision models; one for each indication, were used to estimate the expected costs and outcomes for navigated and standard surgery from a Dutch healthcare perspective over a 3-year time horizon. The models started with a decision tree resulting in a radical or non-radical resection. Subsequently, the Markov-models comprised the health states “stable disease”, “progression” and “death”. The input parameters were based on prospective (navigation cohort n = 33) and retrospective (control group n = 142) data collected at the Netherlands Cancer Institute, reference and unit prices and expert opinion. Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) were measured by the EQ5D-5L. Additionally, a probabilistic sensitivity analysis and a scenario analysis were performed. Results: Navigated surgery showed incremental costs of €3139 and €2857 in LARC and LRRC, respectively. For LARC, for navigation and standard surgery we found: 2.54 vs 2.52 Life Years (LYs), and 2.06 vs 2.04 QALYs. For LRRC we found 2.17 vs 2.11 LYs and 1.73 vs 1.67 QALYs. The base case analysis showed an Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) of €144,192 for LARC and €51,802 for LRRC per QALY gained. At a willingness to pay threshold of €80,000, navigated surgery is not cost- effective in LARC but is cost-effective in LRRC. When a hospital lacks a hybrid OR and needs to invest in one to use the navigation system, which will increase the ICERs for both indications. Finally, more utilization of the navigation system (12% to 50% utilization rate) shows ICERs of € 65,257 and €20,648 for LARC and LRRC, respectively. Conclusions: Based on the current data, the navigation system is expected to be cost-effective in LRRC and has the potential to become cost-effective in LARC. To decrease the costs, it is crucial to identify more surgical indications for image-guided navigation. Especially as in the near future, image-guided surgery is expected to be a standard option in surgical practice. As these findings are sensitive to uncertainty in the data, a randomized controlled trial is advised to perform for relevant indications.
