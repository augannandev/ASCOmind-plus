Methods: The analysis included 132 patients diagnosed with mCRC having metastases in the liver treated from 2015 to 2020. Of these, 62 (47%) were men and 70 (53%) women. The average age of the patients was 63 years. At the beginning of the treatment, the overall condition of all patients met ECOG 0-1 points. Primary metastatic CRC had 93 (71%) patients. A total of 39 (29%) patients were diagnosed with advanced disease. Localization of the primary tumor in 25 patients (18.9%) was in the right part of the large intestine and 107 (81.1%) in the left part of the colon. At the time of the sample, metastases were detected only in the liver in 73 patients (55.3%). In the remaining 59 (44.7%) other organs were affected besides the liver. Various types of surgical treatment of metastases in the liver received 42 (31.8%) patients. The decision on the choice of chemotherapy was made by the attending physician on the basis of the recommendations of NCCN and RUSSCO, taking into account the molecular genetic characteristics of the tumor. The decision to apply and choose the method of surgical treatment was taken in conjunction with the surgeon. Results: From the general population of patients receiving complex therapy, 2 groups were identified, between which a comparison was made. The first group (group A) was 42 (31.8%) patients who received some surgical treatment of the liver. The second group (group B) included 90 (68.2%) patients, who for some reason or another, did not receive any surgical treatment. The groups are fairly homogeneous in their characteristics. The median overall survival (OS) in group A was 40.1 months, and in group B, 22.3 months. A similar trend continued in subgroup analysis. The calculation of the PFS was complicated by the fact that surgical operations were given at different stages of complex treatment. Three-year survival in group A was approximately 50%, and in group B, 28%. "Five-year" survival (In those patients who were observed from the start of the study for all 5 years) in group A was 15 %, and in group B, 5,5%. Conclusions: The inclusion of modern surgical techniques in the complex therapy of metastatic colorectal cancer, if possible, at any stage, can significantly increase the life expectancy of patients.
