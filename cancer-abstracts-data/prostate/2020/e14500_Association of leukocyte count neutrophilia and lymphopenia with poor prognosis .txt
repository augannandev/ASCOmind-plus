Methods: Clinical records of patients treated at the Guatemalan Social Security Institute were registered in the Oncology service within the period from January 1, 2013 to December 2018, the treatment consisted of temozolomide (75 mg / m2 per day) and concomitant radiation and subsequent maintenance with temozolomide (150 mg / m2 D1-5) every 28 days for 6 cycles. The prognostic value of neutrophilia and lymphopenia, prior to treatment in survival, was defined as a neutrophil count greater than 7x10 3 / uL and lymphopenia less than 2 x10 3 / uL. The analysis was performed using Kapplan Mayer curves, log rank test and Cox analysis. Results: We identified 64 high-grade patients (grades III and IV according to WHO), all treatments with concomitant chemoradiotherapy based on temozolomide and subsequent maintenance with temozolamide. The initial surgery was lost in the majority (75%), with resection > 90% in 25 patients (34%). 79.4% were treated with radiotherapy plus concomitant chemotherapy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy with temozolamide of these, 69% completed the treatment, thirty-two patients (50%) with pre-treatment neutrophilia. The overall survival at 2 years was 55%. In the univariate analysis, neutrophilia is associated with a worse overall survival (p = 0.019), as well as lymphopenia (p = 0.003), in addition to the age ≥65 years (p = 0.0001), surgical resection < 90% (p = 0.045) and prednisolone consumption ≥50mg / day (p = 0.045). In the multivariate analysis, neutrophilia (p = 0.017), age ≥65 (p = 0.001), lymphopenia (p = 0.0056) were associated with a worse prognosis with reduced survival. Conclusions: In high-grade gliomas treated with temozolomide and concomitant radiation followed by maintenance with temozolamide, neutrophilia and lymphopenia can be a significant prognostic factor for overall survival, with the advantage that it is not an expensive test and is accessible at all times of patient follow-up.

Search Results Summary:
In previous studies separately, it has already been determined how the inflammatory response measured by it neutrophilia and also lymphopenia s with temozolamide have determined that they are important at the time of initiation of treatment and have a prognostic value in patients with high-grade gliomas, the objective This study was the prognostic value of leukocyte disorders, absolute neutrophil count and absolute lymphocyte count in a retrospective cohort of patients with high-grade glioma who receive concomitant temozolomide and radiation plus maintenance.
