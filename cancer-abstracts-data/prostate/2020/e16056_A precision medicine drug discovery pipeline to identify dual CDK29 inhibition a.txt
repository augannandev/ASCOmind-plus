Therapeutic options for advanced colorectal cancer are limited, and there remains an unmet clinical need to identify new therapies to treat this deadly disease. To address this need, we have developed a precision medicine pipeline that integrates high throughput chemical screens with matched patient-derived cell lines and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) to identify new treatments for CRC. Methods: We used high-throughput chemical screens of 2,100 compounds across five low-passage, patient-derived CRC cell lines. These results were validated using dose-response IC50curves for CDK1, CDK2, CDK9 or CDK1/2/9 inhibitors and by siRNA-mediated knockdown of CDK9 with or without CDK2 inhibition. Cell cycle arrest analysis was performed by flow cytometry and anaphase catastrophe was analyzed by immunofluorescence staining. For in vivo studies, matched PDXs were treated with either CDK2, CDK9 or dual CDK2/9 inhibitors. Results: We identified the CDK inhibitor drug class as among the most effective cytotoxic compounds across all five CRC lines. Further analysis of the CDK inhibitor class revealed that combined targeting of CDK1, 2, and 9 was the most effective, with IC50 in the range of 110 nM to 1.2 Î¼M. We further validated the efficacy of combined CDK2/9 inhibition using siRNA-mediated knockdown of CDK9 in the presence of a CDK2 inhibitor(CVT-313), and showed that CDK9 knockdown acted synergistically with CDK2 inhibition. Dual CDK2/9 inhibition led to significant G2/M cell cycle arrest and anaphase catastrophe. Finally, combined CDK2/9 inhibition in vivo synergistically inhibited PDX tumor growth as compared to single-agent CDK inhibitors. Conclusions: Our precision medicine pipeline revealed CDK2/9 dual inhibition as a combinatorial therapy to treat CRC and can also be used to identify new and novel therapies
