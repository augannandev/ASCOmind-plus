LoConte, Sam Joseph Lubner, Daniel Mulkerin, Nataliya Volodymyrivna Uboha, Dustin A. Deming Organizations University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center, Madison, WI Abstract Disclosures Research Funding No funding received None Background: Advances in the understanding of colorectal cancer (CRC) biology, including clonal evolution are leading to novel treatment strategies. Epidermal growth factor receptor inhibition (EGFRi) with cetuximab or panitumumab has shown significant clinical utility in KRAS/NRAS/BRAF wildtype (wt) CRC. These inhibitors are most commonly used in the third-line treatment setting in the United States. Upon the development of resistance to EGFRi, withdrawal of the EGFR inhibitor can lead to decay of resistant clones allowing for EGFR inhibitor retreatment in additional lines of treatment. Earlier-line use of single agent EGFRi could allow more patients to utilize a retreatment strategy, however no large prospective clinical trials have assessed the clinical activity of second line EGFRi in the setting of molecular selection. Here, we assess the clinical outcomes of EGFRi monotherapy for advanced KRAS wt CRC after initial progression on a single line 5FU based chemotherapy. Methods: A retrospective chart review examined patients who received single agent EGFRi in KRAS wt CRC in the second line setting. Line of therapy was defined at time of metastatic disease or recurrence within 6 months of adjuvant therapy. Clinical outcomes of overall response rate (ORR) and progression free survival (PFS) were assessed per RECIST v1.1. Results: 20 cases were identified who received single agent EGFRi (panitumumab or cetuximab) as monotherapy in the second line setting. All pts received prior 5FU based chemotherapy. Reasons for using EGFR inhibitor monotherapy in this setting included to avoid toxicities from prior chemotherapy (largely immunosuppression and GI toxicities), bridge from recent operative management, or maintain functional performance status. Patients had median age of 62 [45, 89] and majority with ECOG PS 0-1 (78.5% of those reported). Best responses included complete response 7%, partial response 21%, stable disease 64% and progressive disease 7%, and a disease control rate of 93%. The 6 and 8 month PFS were 70% and 50%, respectively. PFS ranged from 1.5 to 17.3 months with median PFS 8.2 Â± 3.6 months. Conclusions: This work demonstrates preliminary efficacy data to use single agent EGFRi in the second-line setting for KRASwt patients with CRC. Future investigations will aim to prospectively validate the benefit of this treatment strategy to facilitate EGFRi retreatment and improve patient survival.
