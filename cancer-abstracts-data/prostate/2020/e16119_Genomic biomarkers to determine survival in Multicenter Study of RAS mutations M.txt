Methods: Multi-institution retrospective study of patients who underwent Y-90 radioembolization treatment after tumor genotyping was completed for CRLM. Patients treated between 2008 and 2019 were included from 7 institutions within the United States and Europe. Patient demographics, tumor characteristics, pre- and post- treatment regimens, serum laboratory evaluation and overall survival were analyzed between patients with differing histopathologic and genomic status. Tumor genotyping was obtained for KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, AKT, MEK, NRAS and MMR genes. Kaplan-Meier survival estimation and multivariate Cox regression were analyzed. Results: 434 patients treated with Y90 radioembolization fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Of the total cohort, 399 patients were available who had sufficient documented tumor profiling data. Average age at diagnosis was found to be 58.8 years for all patients (60.1% male, 39.9% female). Decreased survival post Y-90 treatment was shown in those patients with increased number of documented tumor mutations (n = 0,1 or ≥2 mutations: median OS 9.63 mos vs. 6.2 mos vs. 5.3 mos; p < 0.0001). Additionally, the median survival in patients with mutated BRAF was 5.0 months, as compared to 9.4 months in those patients with wild-type BRAF (p = 0.0009). Primary colon cancer sidedness was also shown to demonstrate significant difference in survival post-Y90 treatment with left sided primaries showing improved median overall survival (left = 7.5 mos vs. right = 6.3 mos; p = 0.04.) Patient demographics including gender, age and race were not shown to be significant in overall survival post-Y90 treatment (p-values > 0.05). Number of tumor mutations (p < 0.0001, HR = 1.69 CI: 1.39-2.05), BRAF status (p = 0.02, HR = 2.6 CI:1.20-4.9), primary sidedness (p = 0.01, HR = 0.65 CI:0.47-0.90), pre-treatment neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (p = 0.04, HR = 1.42 CI: 1.02-1.98) and KRAS mutation status (p < 0.0001, HR = 1.81 CI: 1.45-2.26) all persisted as significant predictors of survival on multivariate analysis. Conclusions: Number of tumor mutations, BRAF mutation status, primary tumor sidedness, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio and KRAS mutation status are all shown to be significant prognostic factors in patients with colorectal liver metastases receiving Y90 radioembolization.
