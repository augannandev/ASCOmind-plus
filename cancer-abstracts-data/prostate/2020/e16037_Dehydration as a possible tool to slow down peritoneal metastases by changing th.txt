As the peritoneum is an optimal biological compartment for metastatic growth, stopping progressive tumor extension at more advanced stages is currently unachievable. With this study, we aim to investigate whether changing the intraperitoneal environment using dehydration might halt tumor progression. Methods: Commercially available human colon cancer cells (HT-29) were dehydrated for 15 minutes at 90% humidity and compared to cells treated with only oxaliplatin. Cell vitality was measured and structural cell changes following dehydration were analyzed via scanning electron microscopy. Additionally, staining with hematoxylin and eosin was performed on peritoneal tissue to assess dehydration effects using an ex vivo model. Finally, a mathematical model was established to measure dehydration of the abdominal compartment for feasibility evaluation. Results: Partial dehydration has a significant cytotoxic effect on colon cancer cells (p< 0.05) even if only shortly applied. The addition of oxaliplatin treatment following dehydration results in highly reduced cell vitality (p< 0.01). Sole dehydration vs. sole oxaliplatin application have similar effects. SEM revealed a cellular collapse of HT-29 cells caused by dehydration. Histopathological examination of peritoneal tissue demonstrated that the dehydration effect is superficial with penetration depths of < 200 µm. Conclusions: Our data indicate that dehydration is a potentially feasible technique with measurable cytotoxic effects on colorectal cancer cells. While changing the physiological milieu of the peritoneal cavity by means of dehydration could significantly reduce PM extent, the consequences of volume fluid loss must be equally considered. Thus, further studies are required to find a sustainable extent of dehydration while maintaining circulatory stability.
