Mainstay of therapy is surgical resection followed by concurrent radiation and temozolomide (TMZ) followed by adjuvant TMZ. Unfortunately, prognosis remains poor and optimization of current therapy is critical. Chronotherapy is defined as improvement in treatment outcomes by maximizing treatment efficacy and minimizing toxicity by administering medications in accordance with biological rhythms of the patient. In a mouse model, there was greater anti-tumor efficacy during morning administration of TMZ. This trial was designed to determine the feasibility and potential clinical impact of chrono-therapeutically administering TMZ in patients with HGG. Methods: Adult patients ( > 18 years) with HGG (WHO Grade III/IV) were eligible. Patients were screened and consented prior to initiation of monthly TMZ therapy. Eligible patients were randomized to TMZ in the morning (AM) before 10AM or in the evening (PM) after 8PM. Pill diaries were recorded for drug administration time and compliance. Fact-Br Quality of Life (QoL) surveys were administered to patients at the time of enrollment in the trial and at the end of treatment to measure differences in QoL in both groups. Circadian rhythm was recorded by Actiwatch. Adverse events (AE), overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) were measured for each group. Results: At the time of submission, a total of 28 patients were evaluated. 15 patients were in AM group and 13 in PM group. It is feasible for participants to take TMZ per study assignment. There was no significant difference in the QoL based on the Fact-Br dataset in the four main categories of physical well-being, social/family well-being, functional well-being and emotional well-being. The Friedmanâ€™s two-way nonparametric ANOVA tests were used to analyze the differences across time points. Cytopenias are a known adverse effect of TMZ. There was a trend towards worsening lymphocyte counts in the AM group compared to PM group, although not statistically significant. There was no statistical significance in PFS or OS in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Conclusions: Chronotherapy with TMZ is feasible. A trend of worsening lymphocyte counts is noted in AM treatment group compared to PM group but was not statistically significant. No difference in OS or PFS was noted, although sample size was too small to effectively assess this. A larger study will need to be conducted to effectively assess the effect of chronotherapy on survival. Clinical trial information: NCT02781792
