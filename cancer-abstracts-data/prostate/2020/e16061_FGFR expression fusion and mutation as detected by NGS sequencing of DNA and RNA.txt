However, FGFR1-4 have been shown to play a major role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis in other types of cancers including colorectal (CRC) and lung cancers. We explored the value of using DNA and RNA next generation sequencing (NGS) in determining the presence of abnormalities in FGFR1-4 in various types of cancer. Methods: Using targeted panel and next generation sequencing (NGS), we analyzed DNA sequencing data (434 genes) in 438 Solid tumors and RNA data (1408 genes) in 160 lung cancers and 53 colorectal cancers (CRC). The expression levels of the CRC and lung cancer were also compared with expression levels of 32 cases of endometrial, urothelial and breast cancers as a group of cancers known to have high incidence. Results: The DNA data showed mutations in 85 samples and CNV in 12 samples. The detected mutations were 18% in FGFR1, 25% in FGFR2, 45% in FGFR3, and 12% in FGFR4. Only 20% of the detected mutations by NGS testing can be detected if the PCR-based FDA-approved kit was used. Analysis of the expression levels of FGFR1-4 mRNA in CRC and lung cancer showed highest expression in FGFR2, followed by FGFR1 then FGFR3. Expression of FGFR4 was the lowest (P < 0.0001). There was no difference between CRC and lung cancer in FGFR1 and FGFR2 mRNA, but FGFR3 was slightly higher in lung cancer as compared with CRC (P = 0.01). FGFR4 was significantly higher in CRC as compared with lung cancer (P < 0.0001). No fusion involving FGFR1-4 was detected in any of the tested CRC or lung cancers. Upon comparing overall expression between CRC/lung cancer with the group of cancers that are known to have high incidence of FGFR1-4 abnormalities (urothelial, breast, and endometrial), FGFR1 and FGFR2 mRNA were significantly lower in CRC/lung cancers (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.0002, respectively), but there was no significant difference in FGFR3. However, significant overlap is noted. In contrast, FGFR4 was significantly higher in CRC (P < 0.0001). Conclusions: This data suggests that while FGFR1-3 genes are overall expressed in CRC and lung, some cases may have significantly high expression of FGFR1-3 and perhaps these cases should be singled out for treatment with FGFR inhibitors. Furthermore, NGS testing for mutations significantly more efficient and can detect significant number of mutations that can be missed if PCR-based testing is used. NGS testing of DNA and RNA is the most appropriate testing for abnormalities in FGFR1-4.
