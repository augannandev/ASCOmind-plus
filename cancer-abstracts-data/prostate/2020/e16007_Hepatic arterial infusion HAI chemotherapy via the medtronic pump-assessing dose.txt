Kemeny Organizations Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY; Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York City, NY; Department of Surgery, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY Abstract Disclosures Research Funding No funding received None Background: Due to the termination of the Codman pump, in order to administer hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) chemotherapy, the Medtronic pump has been used with the Codman catheter at MSKCC since 2018. Methods: Retrospective review of patients(pts) receiving HAI therapy via Medtronic pumps. Expected versus actual dose delivery of HAI FUDR, response rates and safety were reviewed. Results: Pts included; unresectable colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) (94 pts), resected CLRM (66 pts) and unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) (11 pts). Baseline characteristics of the 171 evaluable pts are shown in Table. In 120 pts with mCRC, 51.8% (n = 58) had 10 or more hepatic tumors and 23.2%( n = 26) had 50% or more liver involvement by metastases. 52 out of 171 pts (30.4%) had 100% of the expected FUDR doses by completion of the 3rdcycle. Another 49.7% (85/171) had greater than or equal to 50% of the expected FUDR dose. 96 pts had measurable disease (unresectable CLRM and ICC subgroups) evaluated by RECIST 1.1 with an MSK radiologist. The partial response for unresectable CRLM pts was 47% (41/87), and 28% (24/87) were stable. The partial response for ICC pts was 22% (2/9), and 33% (3/9) were stable. Conclusions: We evaluated 171 pts who were heavily pretreated and had extensive disease prior to pump placement. Partial response by RECIST 1.1 of 47% was evident in those pts with CRLM and 22% for pts with ICC. Dose delivery of HAI FUDR was compatible with that seen with the Codman pump and no increase in toxicity was noted. An updated analysis with additional evaluable pts will be presented at the meeting.
