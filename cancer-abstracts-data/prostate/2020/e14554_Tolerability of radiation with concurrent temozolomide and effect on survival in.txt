Whole brain radiation (WBRT) has often been used but may lead to unacceptable neurocognitive dysfunction. We examined our institutional experience with treating CNSL with radiotherapy (RT) and concurrent temozolomide (TMZ) including the resultant acute and long term toxicities. Methods: This single institution IRB approved retrospective study examined treatment, toxicity, and outcome variables in adults with primary or secondary CNS lymphoma. Inclusion criteria were brain-directed RT and development of the treatment plan at our institution. Three main RT field designs were used, including low and high dose WBRT and low dose WBRT with a focal boost to residual disease (WBRT+boost). We assessed relationships between treatment approach (RT field design and concurrent TMZ use) and clinical outcomes and toxicities using multivariable logistic regression models and Kaplan-Meier methods. Toxicity was recorded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5. Results: A total of 93 patients with median age of 57 years (range 24 – 86) treated from 2004 – 2019 were included, and 26 patients received concurrent TMZ. The RT field design of low dose WBRT (median dose: 23.4Gy) plus focal boost (median dose: 21.6Gy) was associated with favorable overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) without any significant difference in Grade 3+ toxicity compared to low dose WBRT (p = 0.20) or WBRT without boost (p = 0.80). Concurrent TMZ with RT was associated with significantly improved OS (HR 0.46, p = 0.025) and CNS PFS (HR 0.49, p = 0.019). Four of nine (44%) Grade 3+ non-hematologic toxicities occurred in patients receiving concurrent TMZ (p = 0.40). The most common non-hematologic toxicities included fatigue and nausea. Long term neurocognitive dysfunction was similar whether or not patients received concurrent TMZ (21% in TMZ group vs 23% in non-TMZ group; OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.25 – 2.68, p = 0.82) and irrespective of RT field design (WBRT+boost vs low dose WBRT p = 0.25, WBRT+boost vs WBRT without boost p = 0.19). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that concurrent TMZ use with brain RT for chemo-refractory CNSL is a promising strategy, with improved survival and no major additional toxicity. Further research that includes rigorous neurocognitive assessments is needed in prospective clinical trials to guide treatment approaches using concurrent TMZ with brain RT in CNSL patients.
