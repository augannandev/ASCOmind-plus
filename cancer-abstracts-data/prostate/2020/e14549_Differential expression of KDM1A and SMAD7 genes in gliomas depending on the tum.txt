The purpose of the study was to analyze the expression of genes participating in the EGFR, TGF-B, HH/GLI, NOTCH and HIF1-alpha signaling pathways, transcription factors HBP1, MSI1/2 and demethylating agents in samples of various glioma types. Methods: The study included paired samples (tumor and physiologically unchanged neural tissue) obtained from 75 patients with histologically verified glial tumors of various grades (G2 - 21, G3 - 11, G4 - 43 patients). Relative expression of 15 genetic loci (EGFR, SMAD4, SMAD7, SMO, NOTCH1, NOTCH2, HBP1, HIF1A, EGLN1, EGLIN3, KDM1B, KDM1A, MSI1, MSI2, TET1) was measured by RT-qPCR. The PSMC, TBP and RPLO genes were used as the reference sequences. The 2−ΔΔСt method was used to analyze the qPCR data. Statisical processing of the results was performed with the Statistica 10 program (StatSoft Inc., USA). Results: G2 gliomas showed a significant change in the relative expression of the KDM1A gene (p = 0.00572); G3 - a significant change in the relative expression of the HIF1A gene (p = 0.012726); G4 - significant changes in the relative expression of the EGFR (p = 0.021324), SMAD4 (p = 0.016534), SMAD7 (p = 0.000003), HBP1 (p = 0.003264), HIF1A (p = 0.007612), EGLN1 (p = 0.001623), EGLN3 (p = 0.004231) genes. Registered changes in the expression of the KDM1A and SMAD7 genes in the studied sample significantly differentiated the G2 and G4 glial tumors (p = 0.013 and p = 0.049, respectively). G2 tumors were characterized with increased expression of the KDM1A gene and decreased by more than 1.1 times in 95% of patients. 88% of patients with G4 tumors demonstrated no changes or a decrease in the KDM1A gene expression and decreased SMAD7 expression by more than 1.5 times. Conclusions: The established significant change in the expression of the KDM1A and SMAD7 genes depending on the tumor grade can be used for the differential diagnosis of gliomas.
