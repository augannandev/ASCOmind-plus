Many genetic studies have suggested that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPS) in genes encoding small molecule RNAs were associated with CRC risk, but the results were different in different studies. In our study, we investigated the general demographic characteristics and the relationship of hsa-mir-196a2 rs11614913 C > T polymorphism and CRC susceptibility in Chinese CRC. Methods: Our study included 1,003 CRC patients and 1,303 controls. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP-PCR) method was used for genotyping and SAS version 9.4 software for statistical analysis. Results: The incidence of smoking status,alcohol use and BMI in the CRC group (25.82%,17.35%,66.80%) were much higher than that in the control subjects (20.34%,10.44%,52.80%) respectively(P < 0.05). After adjusting age and other factors, hsa-mir-196a2 rs11614913 C > T genotypes were not statistically correlated with CRC risk and tumor location.But the TT genotype in the hsa-mir-196a2 rs11614913 C > T polymorphism reduced the risk of CRC in women (OR = 0.64, 95 CI: 0.42-0.97, P = 0.036). Conclusions: Smoking status,alcohol use and BMI may be main risk factors for CRC development in our study population.The polymorphism of hsa-mir-196a2 rs11614913 C > T gene may affect the risk of CRC in women, which requires further investigation in a larger cohort in the future.
