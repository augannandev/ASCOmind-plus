Previous data suggest KRAS (all) mutations may impact prognosis. Here we assess the clinical features and outcomes of real world patients with KRASG12C mutant metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) to explore any clinicopathologic associations and prognostic impact. Methods: Patients diagnosed with mCRC between January 2011 and December 2018 were included in this prospective mCRC registry. Patients with BRAF mutations, unknown or unspecified KRAS variants were excluded. Clinicopathologic features, treatment and overall survival (OS) were compared for RAS wildtype (RASWT) and KRASG12C mutant patients, and between KRASG12C and other (RASother) mutations. Results: Of 1308 patients analysed, 674 (52%) were RASmut, of whom 56 (8.3%) were KRASG12C. More patients with KRASG12C were female compared to RASother and RASWT (Table). No differences were observed in primary tumor location, number of metastatic sites and distribution of metastases. The proportion of patients undergoing metastasectomy was similar between KRASG12C and RASother, and KRASG12C and RASWT. There was no difference in the proportion of patients receiving systemic therapy. RASWT patients received more lines of therapy. Median OS was similar between KRASG12C, RASother, and RASWT: 31.7 vs 29.2 vs 31.8 months respectively (P = 0.545). Conclusions: KRASG12C mutations were observed in 4.3% of mCRC patients and in 8.3% of RAS mutant cases. Patients with KRASG12C have comparable clinical features to RASWT or RASother mCRC. Treatment and survival were also similar between groups. KRASG12C does not appear to be prognostic, but may be an important predictive biomarker as promising targeted therapies continue to be developed.
