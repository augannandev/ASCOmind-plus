In routine clinical practice elderly patients require comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGO). Despite many treatment strategies for elderly patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), there are no use of rehabilitation programs and the assessment of their impact on the treatment tolerability and survival. Methods: The study includes patients with newly diagnosed mCRC stage IV, receiving the first line of chemotherapy (FOLFOX). Patients are given CGO before starting chemotherapy and in dynamics.The following scales are used for geriatric examination: Cumulative Illness Rating Scale for Geriatrics (CIRS-G); Activities of Daily Living (ADL); Daily instrumental activity scale (IADL); Mini nutritional assessment (MNA); Clock Drawing Test (CDT); Geriatric depression scale (GDS). Results: At the moment 29 patients are included in the study. According the results of CGO we determined that elderly and middle-aged patients are similar in cognitive, mental, and nutritional status, but they have statistically significant differences on the MMSE scale (P=0,014). In both groups patients have a decrease in IADL and cognitive functions, the presence of depression. Elderly patients (> 60 years old) are more likely to experience chronic pain (P<0.05) and increased blood pressure (P<0.05) (Table). Conclusions: The management tactics of patients with mCRC in elderly age shouldn't be based only on chronological age, ECOG or the Karnovsky index, that don't reflect functional disorders in patients of the older age group. It is necessary to define algorithms for medical rehabilitation in cancer patients of the older age group. A CGO is aimed at developing a medical rehabilitation plan together with an elderly patient and his environment, and an algorithm for supporting his health status during and after specialized treatment.
