Background: Testicular germ cell tumor (TGCT) is the most common neoplasm in young men and the incidence has been increasing over the last few decades, especially among Hispanic men. Multidisciplinary management is associated with excellent oncological outcomes. Here, we describe the treatment outcome of TGCT patients treated in single institution in Peru. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of TGCT treated at Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplasicas from 2016 to 2019. Clinical and pathological data were collected from medical records. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with long-rank test. A level of p < 0.05 was considered significant. The statistical package SPSS v19 was used for the data analysis. Results: 221 patients were identified, 56% were non-seminomatous (NS) and 44% were seminomatous (S). Orchiectomy was performed in 94% of patients, only 6% underwent orchiectomy after chemotherapy. In both groups, the treatment regimens were: BEP (Bleomycin/Etoposide/cisplatin) 90%, Carboplatin 8.1% and EP (Etoposide/Cisplatin) 1.8%. 42 (21%) of patients receive rescue therapy, being the most frequent TIP (paclitaxel/ifosfamide/cisplatin). In NS patients, 5-year PFS was superior in good risk compared with poor risk (100% vs. 86%, p = 0.028) and for tumor markers level, S0 was superior to S3 (100% vs. 82%, p = 0.008). In S, 5-year PFS was no significant in any of groups of analysis. With a median follow-up of 57 months, OS in NS was 91%, 83% and 81% in 12, 36 and 60 months, respectively and OS in S was 96%, 87% and 87% in 12, 36 and 60 months, respectively. The analysis of 5-year OS according to clinical stage and risk stratification are shown in the Table 1. Only 2 patients received high-dose chemotherapy and still in complete response. Conclusions: Despite the high incidence of advanced TGCT, our patients had excellent survival results; being lower in those with CS III (both NS and S groups), poor risk and S3 for NS, and intermediate risk for S. Multidisciplinary management in a high volume institution is important for better outcomes in our patients.
