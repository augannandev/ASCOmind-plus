Background: We reported 10-year outcomes of localized prostate cancers treated with hypofractionated intensity-modulated radiotherapy of 45 Gy in 9 consecutive fractions. Methods: From October 2011 to April 2017, thirty patients with localized prostate cancer were enrolled in this prospective trial. The median age of the patients was 72.5 years. According to NCCN recurrence risk criteria, eight patients were at low risk group, 17 at intermediate risk group, 5 at high risk group. All patients were treated with hypofractionated intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) of 45 Gy in 9 consecutive fractions to their prostate with or without seminal vesicles. Before radiotherapy, three gold fiducials were implanted into the prostate. In order to reduce the rectal high dose irradiation volume , an inflated rectal balloon was placed in the rectum at simulation and every treatment and patients were treated with comfortable full bladder. Static Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (SIMRT) was applied in 1 patient, Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) in 27 patients, and tomotherapy in 2 patients. Image guided radiotherapy (IGRT) with gold fiducial registration was adopted. Twenty-six patients also received androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). The median time of ADT was 6 months. Progression⁃free survival(PFS) and overall survival(OS) were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier analysis. All grade ≥1 genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities were recorded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event version 5.0 (CTCAE 5.0) and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) late morbidity criteria , and GU and GI toxicities were cumulatively calculated. Results: After a median follow-up of 102 months (65~131 months), the 10-year OS was 90.0%(95% confidence interval, 83.3%-96.7%), and the 10-year PFS was 86.5% (95% confidence interval, 79.1%-93.9%). According to CTCAE 5.0, grade 1 acute gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity developed in 12 patients, grade 2 in 2 patients, grade 3 in 2 patients, and grade 1 acute genitourinary (GU) toxicity developed in 12 patients, grade 2 in 2 patients, and no grade 3 or higher toxicity occurred. According to RTOG late morbidity criteria, late (≥3 months after radiotherapy) grade 1 GI toxicity developed in 4 patients (13.3%), grade 2 in 1 (3.3%), grade 3 in 1 (3.3%), and late grade 1 GU toxicity occurred in 1 patient (3.3%), grade 2 in 1 (3.3%), grade 3 in 1 (3.3%). No grade 4 or higher GI and GU toxicities developed. Only one grade 3 GI and one grade 2 GU toxicities were observed for the maximum toxicity at the last follow-up. The potency was not evaluated. Conclusions: The 10-year oncologic outcomes of this shortened hypofractionated IMRT regimen for mainly low/intermediate risk prostate cancer patients is favorable with acceptable acute and late toxicities.
