Background: The blockade of the androgen receptor (AR) pathway is essential for the treatment of prostate cancer (PC). Checkpoint inhibitors have limited activity in immunologically cold prostate tumors. Emerging results suggest that AR signaling modulates CD8+ T cells and modifies its cytotoxic function, but the therapeutic role of NK cells in anti-tumor immune response in PC remains unknown. We investigated the mechanisms of AR inhibitors (ARi) enzalutamide (Enza) and darolutamide (Daro) on the antitumor function of NK cells and their enhancement when combined with NKG2A inhibitor. Methods: We performed co-culture assays with PC cell lines (LNCap, 22Rv1 [ARv7 mutation], DU145, PC3 [AR-]) and NK-92 cells, in a 1:1 ratio, in the presence of ARi and in combination with the anti-NKG2A mAb monalizumab and analyzed immune cell-mediated tumor cell killing (ImageXpress Confocal HT). NK cells expression of NKG2A and PD-1 receptors and PC cell lines expression of HLA-E and PD-L1 were investigated after treatment with Enza and Daro by flow cytometry. Results: ARi significantly increased immune-mediated NK-92 cell killing of PC cell lines at 24hrs (control[C]: 15.8%±3.9; Enza: 40%±4.3; Daro: 36%±3.72, p < 0.0001). This immune enhancement effect was increased by NKG2A blockade with monalizumab ([C]: 31.2%±3.1, [T]: 43.92%±4.52, p = 0.0045). Treatment of the LNCaP cell line (AR+) with ARi increased HLA-E ([MFI values x10³] control[C]: 28.57±2.9; [T]: 37.38 ±1.2 p = 0.0046) and PD-L1 expression ([MFI values x10³] control[C]: 163.1±8.1; [T]: 202.5±11.2 p = 0.003). No significant difference was observed in the surface expression of these markers in the AR- cell lines. NKG2A surface expression on NK cells was also upregulated upon treatment with ARi ([MFI values x10³] control[C]: 52.42±2.9; [T]: 61.4 ±2.2 p = 0.008). Conclusions: Enza and Daro enhance NK cell killing of PC cell lines, and the combination of ARi with checkpoint inhibitor monalizumab promotes NK cell activation. Blockade of AR signaling modulates PC cells' expression of HLA-E and PD-L1 and NK cell expression of NKG2A. These results describe a novel modulatory effect of androgen on NK cell function and provide insights for future NK-cell-based therapeutic approaches for treating PC. Experiments validating these results in patient samples are ongoing.
