Background: Overall survival (OS) of metastatic Prostate Cancer (mPC) in USA has improved by 3.6% during 2011–2016 compared to 2001–2005 (CDC, Oct 2020). Improvements in OS for mPC might reflect changes in clinical management, with approval of several new treatments. We aim to analyze if there is an improvement in OS of mPC in Kentucky between 2004-2011(T1) and 2012-2019(T2) and also analyze the impact of socioeconomic status as defined by Area Deprivation Index (ADI) on survival of mPC. Methods: All Kentucky male patients diagnosed between 2004 and 2019 who were > 20 years old at diagnosis with first primary of metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma were extracted from the Kentucky Cancer Registry (KCR) data. Basic demographics and survival outcomes were compared between two time periods - T1 vs T2 and by Appalachian status. Kaplan Meir (KM) and Multivariate Cox Regression (MCR) were used to examine OS. ADI is divided into three groups – bottom tertile (low deprivation-ADI 1-3, Gr 1), middle tertile (ADI 4-6, Gr 2), and top tertile (high deprivation-ADI 7-10, Gr 3). Results: A total of 2619 patients with mPC were included in this retrospective analysis, of which 69.3% were Non-Appalachian (Non-AP) and 30.7% were Appalachian (AP). Caucasians predominated in both time periods (89.2% vs 90%). T2 had a higher proportion of patients aged 50-74 years (72.5% vs 64.2%), and private insurance (31.4% vs 27.1%) compared to T1. T1 had more patients who were > 75 years (31.6% vs 24.8%), smokers (51.2% vs 47.4%), had medicare (59.6% vs 56.8%) and no insurance (4.2% vs 1.5%) compared to T2. KM showed improved OS in T2 (p < 0.0001). Non-AP had better OS compared to AP and improved more between T1 & T2. Median OS in months(95% CI) in T1 vs T2 for Non-AP was - 30(27-38) vs 58(53-69), p < 0.0001 & for AP was -34 (27-39) vs 44 (37-51), p = 0.0163. MCR showed that younger age, private insurance, being a nonsmoker, and receiving treatment, contributed to better OS. Gr 3 had higher proportion of African Americans (10.7% vs 6.5%), less private insurance (23.9% vs 39.7%) and more patients receiving no treatment (10.9% vs 7.5%) compared to Gr 1. AP Kentucky had more patients in Gr 3 (60.5% vs 39.5%) compared to Non-AP. KM showed OS had improved for all ADI groups in T2 vs T1. Within ADI groups, Gr 3 had significantly lower OS compared to Gr 1 & Gr 2 (p = 0.04) in T2. In T1, OS was not different within ADI groups. In MCR, race and ADI did not impact OS. Conclusions: OS has improved in mPC patients in Kentucky during 2012-2019, likely due to new treatments being available. There is improvement in OS in Appalachian Kentucky but numerically lower than Non-Appalachian, and worse OS in Gr 3 during 2012-2019 which could be partially due to differences in access to new treatments (or quality of care). Interestingly, race did not impact survival.
