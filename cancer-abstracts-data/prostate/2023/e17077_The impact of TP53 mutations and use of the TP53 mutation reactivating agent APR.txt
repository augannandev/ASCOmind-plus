We chose to further explore the impact of dominant negative (DN) TP53 mutations on mCSPC progression and pro-metastatic behaviors in addition to studying the ability of APR-246, a small molecule targeting TP53 mutants, to blunt pro-metastatic behaviors. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 531 mCSPC patients who underwent next generation sequencing. Patients were stratified by metastasis timing (synchronous if metastasis present at diagnosis or metachronous if arising after definitive treatment of localized disease) and the number of metastatic lesions (oligometastatic <5 or polymetastatic > 5 lesions). Tumors were classified based on TP53 mutation status (missense, truncating, or wild-type [WT]) and dominant negativity, which was defined as production of a mutant protein that reduces the residual WT protein's transcriptional activity according to World Health Organization TP53 database. Clinical outcomes were radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) and overall survival (OS), evaluated with Kaplan-Meier and multivariable Cox regression. To verify the impact of TP53 mutation on metastasis, we created isogenic 22Rv1 prostate cancer cell lines that carried either TP53 WT or TP53 R175H and tested this mutation for migration, invasion, and anchorage-independent growth. APR-246 (25-80 µM) was tested for anti-metastatic properties in vitro and anti-tumor growth in 22Rv1 xenografted nude mice. Results: In our cohort, 155 (29.2%) had a TP53 mutation, which mostly occurred in the DNA-binding domain (85.16%). DN TP53 mutations were associated with more aggressive disease states: DN TP53 mutations were enriched in patients with synchronous (vs. metachronous: 20.7% vs. 6.3%, p < 0.01) and polymetastatic disease (vs. oligometastatic: 14.4% vs. 7.9%, p < 0.01). On multivariable analysis, DN TP53 mutations were correlated with shorter rPFS (HR = 1.97, 95%CI: 1.31-2.98, p < 0.01) and OS (HR = 2.05, 95%CI: 1.14-3.68, p = 0.02) compared to those with TP53 WT. In vitro, 22Rv1 cells with DN TP53 R175H mutations had increased ability to migrate, invade, and form colonies compared to TP53 WT cells. APR-246 treatment of TP53 R175H mutants blunted the pro-metastatic effects of the cell line in vitro (p < 0.01 for all assays by unpaired t-test). Interestingly, APR-246 inhibited xenograft tumor growth of 22Rv1 TP53 R175H prostate cancer cells (p < 0.0001 by two-way ANOVA). Conclusions: DN TP53 mutations were associated with poorer survival outcomes for mCSPC patients. DN TP53 mutations also promoted prostate cancer pro-metastatic behaviors in vitro, which was effectively counteracted by APR-246, making it a promising treatment option that should be explored further in early-phase clinical studies.
