Histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases dictate the presence of acetyl marks, which regulate chromatin and transcriptional activation. We previously developed a novel ‘histone array on a chip’ to measure HME dysregulation associated with the development of castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) (ACS Chem Biol 2017). This approach identified decreased SIRT2 expression and increased p300 activity leads to a concerted mechanism of hyperacetylation at specific histone lysine sites (H3K9, H3K14, and H3K18) in CRPC xenografts. These alterations were subsequently validated in castration-resistant tissues (BMC Cancer 2017). The goal of the current study was to determine if circulating tumor cells (CTCs) could be used as a therapeutic biomarker to identify patients with altered p300 acetylation activity. Methods: Blood was collected from 11 CRPC and 3 hormone-sensitive patients with advanced PC under an IRB-approved protocol. PBMCs were isolated with Ficoll-paque PLUS, and lymphocytes were depleted using anti-CD45 magnetic beads. CTCs were then captured with EpCAM labeled coated magnetic beads. Bound cells were isolated with Exclusion-based Sample Preparation (ESP) technology. Bound cells were moved through staining and washing wells prior to imaging at 20x on a fluorescent microscope. Images were analyzed with NIS Elements software. Results: We initially optimized the staining of acetyl-p300, total p300, H3K18ac, and SIRT2 in single cell prostate cancer cell cultures. Exposure to A-485, a selective p300/CBP catalytic inhibitor, reduced levels of p300 and H3K18 acetylation confirming assay specificity. CTCs from patient samples were then captured by EpCAM antibody binding and target staining revealed clear expression of acetyl-p300, acetyl-H3K18, SIRT2, and CK (cytokeratin). No expression of CD45+ cells (lymphocyte exclusion) is noted. Acetyl-p300 displayed a strong positive correlation with its target acetylated H3k18 (Pearson’s r = 0.61), and SIRT2 expression showed robust negative correlation with H3k18 (r = -0.60). A distinct group of 6/11 (55%) of CRPC patients demonstrated altered expression. In one subject with an untreated CSPC sample and subsequent CRPC sample ( > 12mo) a loss of SIRT2 expression, increased p300 activity, and histone H3 hyperacetylation are associated with the transition from hormone-sensitive to CRPC. Conclusions: Acetyl-p300, H3K18ac, and SIRT2 increase in a subset of CTC from patients with CRPC. These biomarkers are associated with increased CBP/p300 activity. This biomarker suite could potentially be used for noninvasive monitoring of outcomes and predicting tumor responses to CBP/p300 acetylation inhibitors in clinical development.
