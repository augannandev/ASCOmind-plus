Background: The incidence of metastatic prostate cancer has increased dramatically between 2010 and 2017 in the United States. Since the racial and ethnic mix of the population of the United States (U.S.) have changed between the years 2010 and 2020–it is extremely important to understand its effects on prostate cancer outcomes. Therefore, we investigated the burden of illness across racial groups and income levels among patients diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer. Methods: This study utilized the U.S. 2017 National Inpatient Sample database to identify hospitalizations with a primary diagnosis of prostate cancers. We evaluated associations between race and income levels, and the burden of illness (total charges and length of stay (LOS)) adjusting for patient and clinical factors with multivariable generalized linear models. Results: A total of 63,880 metastatic prostate cancer patients were included in the study, and the median [IQR] age was 74 [66, 82]. There were 65.6% Whites, 20.6% Blacks, 7.7% Hispanics, and 6.1% Asians and Others. Blacks had a higher prevalence in the age group 45-55 (34.2%), when compared to 55-64 (29.8%), or > 65 (17.6%) age group. There were only 10% Blacks and 4.9% Hispanics living in high-income neighborhoods, whereas this was 75.5% for Whites. In the adjusted analysis, compared to the Whites, Hispanics (1.43; 95%CI-1.29- 1.57), and Asians and Others (1.39; 95%CI- 1.25- 1.56) had a higher total charge; and compared to Whites, Blacks had a higher LOS (1.28; 95%CI-1.15-1.44). Compared to high-income neighborhoods, those living in the 26th to 50th percentile had a lower total charge (0.86; 95%CI- 0.78-0.94). Compared to the > 65 years age group, the 44-55 age group had a lower total charge (0.73; 95%CI-0.61-0.89). Compared to patients with Medicare, those with Private Insurance (0.87; 95%CI- 0.80-0.94) and Self-pay and Others (0.73; 95C%CI-0.62–0.86) had a lower total charge. And when compared to non-elective admissions, elective admissions had a higher total charge (1.44; 95%CI-1.29- 1.59). Conclusions: Hispanics and Asians and Others had a higher burden of illness, and Blacks had a higher LOS. Patients who reside in lower income neighborhoods had lower total charges. Understanding prostate cancer outcomes by race and income is crucial to designing strategies to improve access to care.
