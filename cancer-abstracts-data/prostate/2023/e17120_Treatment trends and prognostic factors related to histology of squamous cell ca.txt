Background: Excluding skin cancers, prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in males. Over 93% of prostate cancers are adenocarcinomas, and as such, an abundance of literature exists with regards to its screening, treatment, and prognosis. Often overlooked, however, data is lacking with regards to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the prostate, a rare alternative form of prostatic cancer comprising fewer than 1% of malignancies. Given the rarity of SCC of the prostate there are neither accepted treatment guidelines nor consistent characterizations of the disease’s histogenesis and histopathology. This study seeks to improve existing guidelines on the treatment of prostate SCC by supplementing current literature with a novel method of longitudinal data collection in the form of the SEER database. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study utilizing the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database sponsored by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Investigated variables entailed patient demographics such as race and age, tumor characteristics including grade, tumor type, and histopathologic characteristics. Treatment modalities (surgical resection, radiation therapy, and systemic therapy) as well as disease characteristics were considered in generating Kaplan Meier overall survival (OS) curves compared using log rank test. Results: The most abundantly utilized treatment was surgery (58.6%), either alone or in conjunction with systemic and radiotherapy. Surgery alone was utilized for 24 patients and chemotherapy alone was utilized for 7 patients. Interestingly, only 14% of patients received multimodality treatment. Prostatic squamous cell carcinoma was the ultimate cause of death in 63.8% of cases. Kaplan Meier analysis demonstrated a median OS of 13 months. When stratifying by histopathologic characteristics, our results showed a significant difference in overall survival between patients with papillary carcinoma, with the median survival time of four years, and non-keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma, with a median survival time of one year (p = 0.005). Conclusions: Further studies are warranted regarding this exceedingly rare and understudied malignancy. The current analysis suggests subclassification of SSC of the prostate into papillary versus non-keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma may yield valuable prognostic information. Further research may emphasize this distinction as well as the role of multimodal treatment which appears to be underrepresented in SSC of the prostate when compared to other similar malignancies.
