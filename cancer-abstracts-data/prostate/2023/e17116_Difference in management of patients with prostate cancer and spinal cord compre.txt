Background: Spinal Cord Compression (SCC) secondary to metastatic prostate cancer is a complication that can lead to irreversible loss of neurologic function. Many factors including age, comorbidities, severity of the compression, and neurological deficit can affect the treatment from conservative management to radiation and surgery. We aimed to study the difference in practice patterns and their outcomes in teaching hospitals (TH) vs non-teaching hospitals (NTH) in the United States. Methods: Utilizing the National Inpatient Sample Database (NIS), we conducted a retrospective cohort study on hospitalizations with prostate cancer and SCC between 2016 and 2020 across the US. Patients were divided into two groups of TH and NTH. Demographics, comorbidities, treatment modality, length of hospitalization, costs, and mortality were compared between the two groups. We also studied patients’ characteristics and outcomes in TH and NTH according to their treatment strategy. Results: We identified 11,380 metastatic prostate cancer patients with SCC admitted to the hospitals with a 7-day median length of stay. While 27.4% underwent surgical procedure and 11.5% received inpatient radiation, 61.2% were treated conservatively. The median cost of hospitalization was $21,922 in TH and $15,141 in NTH (P< 0.001). Although the median age and Charlson Comorbidity Index did not differ between two groups (P =0.12 & 0.66 respectively), patients in TH were more likely to receive intervention (either radiation or surgery) compared to NTH (Surgery: 28.2% in TH vs 23.0% in NTH; P <0.01 & Radiation: 12.1% in TH vs 8.2% in NTH; P <0.01). Mortality rate was lower in TH than NTH (4.5% vs 7.9%; P < 0.01). In both TH and NTH, patients with private insurance were more likely to undergo surgery (TH: Surgery 25.1% vs Radiation 18.8%; P< 0.05 & NTH: Surgery 27.0% vs 6.9% P< 0.05). Among different races, black patients were more likely to receive radiation than surgery in TH (34.2% vs 26.8%; P <0.05). With no difference in comorbidities between surgery and radiation group in TH (P =0.16), all-cause mortality was higher for those who received radiation than for surgery (4.4% vs 1.9%; P <0.05). Conclusions: This study indicated that practice pattern for the management of SCC in prostate cancer is different in teaching and non-teaching hospitals. In addition to more surgery being performed in teaching hospitals, the mortality rate was also lower. There was an association between race and insurance type with different treatment modalities. We also revealed that all-cause mortality was higher with radiation therapy compared to surgery in teaching hospitals.
