We report clinical outcomes of pts based on pathology in primary tumor and from post-chemotherapy non-RP disease surgical resection. Methods: The prospectively maintained Indiana University testicular cancer database was queried for pts with metastatic NSGCT treated between 1990-2021 who completed first-line chemotherapy and had residual extra-RP disease in the absence of residual RP disease. Pts who had post-chemo non-RP surgical resection were included. Kaplan-meier methods were used to analyze progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Results: 131 pts met eligibility. Median age at diagnosis was 28.6 (range, 16.2-51.5). Primary site was testis in 130 pts (99%). Primary tumor predominant histology was embryonal (34.4%), mixed (26%), choriocarcinoma (14.5%), teratoma (11.5%), yolk sac (10.7%), seminoma (1.5%). Metastatic sites at diagnosis were lung (27.5%), brain (19.8%), RP (14.5%), liver (8.4%), mediastinal LN (7.6%), bone (7.6%). All pts with RP mets at diagnosis had normalization of RP nodes after chemo. All pts had surgical resection of non-RP disease. None had RPLND. IGCCCG risk was good in 56, intermediate in 23, and poor in 52 pts. Median pre-chemo AFP was 66.7 (0.9-467,000). hCG was 692 (0.5-500,000). First-line chemo was BEPX4 in 68, BEPX3 in 29, EPX4 in 10, VIPX4 in 8, and other in 16 pts. 76 pts (58%) had teratoma in the primary tumor. Median follow-up was 3.16yrs. 2-yr PFS for pts with teratoma in primary was 59% (95% CI 45-71) vs. 54% for pts without (95% CI 38-67); p = 0.42. 2-yr OS for pts with teratoma in primary was 85% (95% CI 73-92) vs. 70% for pts without (95% CI 54-81); p = 0.18. 2-yr PFS and OS based on pathology and location of non-RP site are listed in Table 1. Conclusions: The presence of teratoma in primary tumor and post-chemotherapy non-RP resections is not associated with worse PFS or OS in pts with metastatic NSGCT. 2-yr PFS (95% CI) p-value 2-yr OS (95% CI) p-value Teratoma in primary site · Teratoma present · Teratoma absent 59% (45-71) 54% (38-67) 0.42 85% (38-67) 70% (54-81) 0.18 Post-chemo extra-RP site residual pathology: · Teratoma · Necrosis · Active GCT 89% (70-96) 62% (40-78) 37 (21-52) 0.03 100% (100-100) 75 (52-88) 69 (51-82) 0.03 Post-chemo lung resection residual pathology: · Teratoma · Necrosis · Active GCT 89 (63-97) 57 (33-76) 26 (7-52) 0.02 100% (100-100) 74% (48-88) 65% (31-85) 0.005 Post-chemo brain resection residual pathology: · Active GCT 23% (4-52) - 70% (33-89) -
