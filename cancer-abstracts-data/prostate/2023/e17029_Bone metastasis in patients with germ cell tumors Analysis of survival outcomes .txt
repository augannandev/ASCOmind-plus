Background: Bone metastasis (BM) is uncommon in patients with germ-cell tumor (GCT). There is lack of data regarding optimal treatment approach. We report the outcomes and prognostic factors in 99 pts with BM treated at our institution. Methods: We identified 99 pts with GCT and BM treated at Indiana University between year 1986-2021. Kaplan-Meier methods were used for progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) analysis. Results: Median age was 31.5 (range, 13.1-58.8). Primary tumor histology was non-seminoma in 77 and pure seminoma in 22. Predominant histology was seminoma in 26, yolk sac tumor 23, mixed 16, embryonal ca 12, teratoma 10, choriocarcinoma 9. Other mets sites included lungs in 68, RP LNs in 63, liver in 34, brain in 19. BM location was spine in 73, pelvic bones in 22, humerus/femur in 14, ribs in 10, sternum/clavicle in 7. Median pre-chemo AFP was 438 (range, 1-75,414) and hCG 80 (range, 0.7-1,700,000). 1L chemo was BEP x4 in 46, VIPx4 in 10, BEP x3 + EP x1 in 8, EP x4 in 8, BEP x3 in 7, VIPx3 in 1, and other in 19. Histology of BM resection for those who underwent surgery was viable non-teratoma GCT in 6, teratoma in 1, malignant transformation of teratoma in 3, and necrosis in 3. 28 had radiotherapy to symptomatic BM. 80 (82.5%) pts progressed after 1L chemo and 46 (53.5%) progressed after 2L chemo. With median f/u from diagnosis of 5.7 years, 5 yr PFS was 17.8% (95% CI 10.3-27.0) and 5 yr OS was 59.9% (95% CI 47.9-70.0). For pts with pure seminoma, 5 yr PFS was 29.8% (95% CI 12.4-49.5) and 5 yr OS 83.1% (95% CI 55.7-94.3). For non-seminoma: 5 yr PFS was 14.6% (95% CI 6.9-25.1) and 5 yr OS 52.2% (95% CI 38.4-64.2). Multivariable analysis indicated that pts with concurrent liver and/or brain mets had worse OS. Conclusions: Outcomes of pts with GCT and BM are inferior than what is expected based on IGCCCG risk categories. Pts with concurrent liver and/or brain mets have particularly worse OS outcomes.
