A substantial proportion of patients experience significant morbidity related to biopsy, including pain, anxiety, and discomfort which may discourage follow-up biopsy crucial for identifying progression or discourage enrollment in active surveillance programs that require serial biopsy. Guided meditation significantly reduces pain and anxiety during breast biopsy. We developed a brief mind-body intervention that could easily integrate into general practice for patients during prostate biopsy and compared patient-reported outcomes after biopsy with and without this intervention. Methods: We conducted a clinically-integrated randomized controlled trial (MSK IRB 18-089) of a brief mind-body intervention during prostate biopsy compared to usual care. All adult patients offered biopsy were eligible. Patients randomized to the intervention were offered both a pre-biopsy mind-body exercise and guided mindfulness meditation during biopsy via headphones. The primary outcome of interest was any severe patient-reported pain, anxiety, discomfort, or tolerability on a visual-analog scale (0-10). We compared the proportion of men in each arm reporting a severe score (7-10) on any of the four scales using Fisher’s exact test. The pre-specified clinically relevant improvement justifying integration into clinical practice was 15%. We compared means separately using ANCOVA with randomization stratum (first vs. prior biopsy) as a covariate. Results: 238 patients (119 per arm) enrolled. 102 in the intervention arm and 94 in the usual care arm proceeded to biopsy and completed the questionnaire. A total of 37/94 (39%) and 38/102 (37%) patients in the usual care and the intervention arms, respectively, reported severe scores in any of the four domains, a difference of 2.1% (95% confidence interval -13, 17%, p = 0.8). The upper bound of the confidence interval includes the pre-specified clinically relevant difference. There was no evidence of a difference in mean post-biopsy anxiety (p = 0.3), discomfort (p = 0.09), pain (p = 0.4) or tolerability scores (p = 0.2), Table. Conclusions: There was no difference in patient reported outcomes between a mind-body intervention and usual care for prostate biopsy. Though the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval included the clinically relevant difference in severe scores, the difference in means for each outcome suggests a clinically meaningful benefit for this brief mindfulness intervention is unlikely.
