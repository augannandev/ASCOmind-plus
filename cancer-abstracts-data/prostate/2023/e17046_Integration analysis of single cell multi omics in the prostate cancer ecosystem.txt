However, the content of how heterogeneity is shaped by tumors and stromal cells or vice versa remains poorly understood. Methods: Single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics and bulk ATAC-sequence from a series of human PCa and normal control were integrated. Results: We identified a stemness subset of club cells marked with SOX9highARlow expression, which enriched significantly after neoadjuvant androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT). Furthermore, a subset of CD8+CXCR6+ T cell, functioned as effector T cell, was observed to be markedly reduced in the malignant PCa patients. Notably, immunosuppressive microenvironment in advanced PCa was associated with infiltration of regulatory T cells (Tregs), which is potentially induced by FAP+ fibroblasts (cancer-associated fibroblasts, CAFs subset). Moreover, for spatial transcriptome analysis, we comprehensively utilized machine learning and computational intelligence to identify cellular diversity of prostate and cell-cell communication with each other in situ.Importantly, we also depicted macrophage and neutrophil state transition under different biological conditions in vivo. Conclusions: We delineate the cellular heterogeneity in the stage-specific PCa microenvironment at single-cell resolution, uncover their reciprocal crosstalk with disease progression and these results will be helpful in exploring potential target for PCa therapy.
