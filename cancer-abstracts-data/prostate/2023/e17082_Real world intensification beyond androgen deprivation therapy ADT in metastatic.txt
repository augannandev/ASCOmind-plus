Given the evolving treatment landscape since 2016, there is a need to understand the translation of clinical evidence and guidelines into clinical practice. Therefore, we examined the use of, and factors associated with intensification beyond ADT in men with mHSPC. Methods: A retrospective cohort of men treated for mHSPC was selected from private insurance claims of the Komodo Research Dataset (Jan 2017-Sep 2023). Men with mHSPC were identified based on their earliest claim for metastasis on or after prostate cancer diagnosis date without evidence of castration resistance. Index date was the earliest claim of ADT following mHSPC. Continuous insurance coverage for ≥ 12 months pre- (baseline) and ≥ 4 months post-index was required. Intensification beyond ADT was defined as the addition of ARPIs, docetaxel or both within ±4 months of the index date. Multinomial regression was conducted to examine factors associated with ADT intensification. Results: The study cohort comprised of 10,717 men with mHSPC with a median age of 65 years. Most had de novo mHSPC (62%), bone-only metastases (49%), hypertension (68%), diabetes (29%), and received opioids (59%) at baseline. Overall, in addition to ADT, 28% received ARPI (abiraterone: 18%, androgen receptor inhibitors: 10%), 9% docetaxel and 2.5% ARPI + docetaxel. From 2017 to 2023, there has been an increase in the intensification of ADT with ARPI from 13% to 47% and with docetaxel + ARPI from 0.8% to 15%, while the use of ADT + docetaxel declined from 12% to 3% and ADT alone from 74% to 36%. Key factors (age, comorbidity, de novo mHSPC, bone metastases) associated with intensification with either docetaxel or ARPI are listed in Table. Conclusions: There was a linear increase in intensification with ARPI and/or docetaxel in mHSPC between 2017-2023 in the US. Findings highlight a gradual uptake of guideline-recommended treatment for men with mHSPC, while over a third are still receiving ADT alone.
