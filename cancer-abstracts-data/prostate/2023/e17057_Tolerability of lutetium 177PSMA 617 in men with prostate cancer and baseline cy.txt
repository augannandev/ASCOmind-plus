Background: Results from the VISION trial (NCT03511664) led to the approval of lutetium-177 (177Lu)–PSMA-617 for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). This trial excluded patients with baseline cytopenias, thus safety in this frequently encountered patient population is unknown. We aimed to use real-world data to describe the tolerability of radioligand therapy in those with poorer bone marrow reserve. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the records of all patients, who received a first dose of 177Lu–PSMA-617 at Mayo Clinic in the interval of April 26, 2022, to December 1, 2022 . Patients were categorized as having poor marrow reserve on the basis of pre-treatment hematologic parameters, including: (1) an anemia cohort with hemoglobin (Hg) less than 9 g/dL, (2) a thrombocytopenia cohort with platelets (Plt) less than 100 x 109/L, (3) a leukopenia cohort with white blood cell count (WBC) less than 2.5 x 109/L, and (4) a multiple cytopenia cohort. These were exclusionary parameters from the VISION trial. Longitudinal laboratory data and clinical outcomes were collected and analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: At data cutoff, 185 patients had received one or more doses of 177Lu, including 26 (14%) with at least one baseline cytopenia prior to their first cycle of treatment. In total, there were 19 (73%) patients with anemia, 3 (12%) with thrombocytopenia, 2 (8%) with leukopenia, and 2 (8%) with multiple cytopenias at baseline. The median number of cycles received thus far is 3, including 14 (54%) who are still receiving therapy and 12 (46%) who have permanently discontinued treatment. Median longitudinal changes in blood counts for the anemia cohort are presented in Table 1. Reasons for treatment discontinuation include: toxicity (n = 2), disease progression (n = 5), death (n = 4), or other (n = 1). Dose reductions or treatment delays for worsening myelosuppression were utilized in 3 (12%) and 5 (19%) patients, respectively. Transfusions of packed red blood cells or platelets were required for 16 (62%) patients. A total of 6 (23%) received care in the emergency department or were hospitalized. Conclusions: Treatment discontinuation for toxicity was rare among men with mCRPC and baseline cytopenias, while receiving 177Lu; however, these patients have an overall poor prognosis.
