Background: Prostate cancer is most common cancer among men and is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in American men. Genetic predisposition to cancer is increasingly noted as a cause in many cancers including prostate cancer. Genetic testing and counseling are recommended in certain groups of men; Men with or without a personal history of prostate cancer who have a family history of prostate, breast, colon, ovarian, or pancreatic cancers, especially if any of these were diagnosed under age 50 and those with metastatic prostate cancer. A recent study of 3,600 men with prostate cancer found that 17% had inherited genetic mutations that may have contributed to their cancer. Of those men, 31% of the mutations were in the BRCA genes. Because of this, familiarity and understanding of the most current clinical guidelines for genetic risk assessment are of great importance in the survivorship care of men with prostate cancer. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines recommends genetic assessment/counseling for genetic/familial high-risk individuals diagnosed with prostate cancer. This retrospective study reports on adherence to genetic screening based on NCCN guidelines for newly diagnosed Prostate cancer patients who were receiving treatment at Northeast Georgia Medical Center (NGMC). Methods: We obtained data using EPIC database from NGMC electronic medical records to identify patients who were diagnosed between 1/1/20-12/31/20. Data included patients who were high risk and fit the criteria for genetic testing based on NCCN as well as identifying patients who were sent for genetic testing/counsellng. The dataset was de-identified and analyzed using appropriate descriptive statistical testing. Results: A total of 42 cases for prostate cancer were reviewed. All 42 of the cases were under the age of 60 at diagnosis. A total of 13 of the cases meet the genetic/familial high-risk assessment based on NCCN guidelines. Of the 13 of the cases, only 1 case was referred for genetic counseling which was 7.6% compliance with NCCN guidelines for genetic counseling/referral. In terms of high-penetrance prostate cancer risk screening, none of the 13 cases (0%) meeting genetic/familial high-risk were screened. Based on our findings, there was poor adherence in genetic testing/counseling in high risk patients with prostate cancer at NGMC. Conclusions: This study points out poor adherence to NCCN guideline directed genetic counseling/testing in high risk patients with prostate cancer. Based on findings, it is clear that high importance should be placed on awareness on the current guidelines in relation to gene testing for patients who are high risk as this would play an important role in identifying family members who at risk and ensure early screening.
