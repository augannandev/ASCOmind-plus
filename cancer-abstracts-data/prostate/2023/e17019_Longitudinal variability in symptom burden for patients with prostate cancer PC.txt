The longitudinal fluctuations in symptom burden for a given individual with PC, or for groups with different PC disease states, are not well-described. We assessed self-rated performance status (PS), pain interference with daily activities, bother from sexual dysfunction, depression, and anxiety symptoms longitudinally for a cohort of patients with PC. Methods: For one year, patients with PC and ≥1 Urology or Medical Oncology clinic visit in the prior 6 months were emailed surveys every 60 days containing the ECOG PS instrument (range 0-4, higher scores = worse PS), PROMIS Pain Interference Short Form 4a (normalized range 1-5, higher scores = greater pain interference), PROMIS Sexual Bother (Male) items SFBOT 204, 205, and 206 (normalized range 1-5, higher scores = greater bother), PHQ-9 depression scale (range 0-27, score ≥10 considered positive for moderate symptoms), and GAD-7 anxiety scale (range 0-21, score ≥10 considered positive for moderate symptoms). We used chart review to obtain baseline characteristics and one-way ANOVA for comparisons. Results: For 201 enrolled patients, mean (SD) number of surveys completed was 5.8 (1.8) over a mean (SD) of 10.6 (3.1) months. At baseline, 50.7% had localized PC (LPC), 18.9% biochemically recurrent PC (BCR-PC), and 30.3% metastatic PC (MPC). 40.8% of patients were on androgen deprivation therapy, which was not associated with greater sexual bother (p = 0.17). Mean (SD) values for ECOG PS, pain interference, sexual bother, the PHQ-9, and the GAD-7 are shown by PC disease state (Table). For patients who completed ≥2 surveys (N = 192), mean (SD) ranges for these scales were 0.4 (0.6), 0.8 (0.9), 1.2 (0.8), 3.7 (3.3), and 2.6 (2.6), respectively. Mean range differed by PC disease state for ECOG PS (0.31 LPC vs 0.63 BCR-PC vs 0.59 MPC, p = 0.003) and pain interference (0.63 LPC vs 1.02 BCR-PC vs 0.95 MPC, p = 0.03). For patients with ≥1 positive PHQ-9 (N = 36) or GAD-7 (N = 11) screen over ≥2 surveys, a mean (SD) of 41% (30%) and 39% (33%), respectively, of their total screens were positive. Mean (SD) ranges for these patients were 8.4 (3.6) for the PHQ-9 and 8.5 (3.4) for the GAD-7 (both p < 0.001 compared with those who never screened positive). Conclusions: Patients with more advanced PC had worse PS, pain, and depression, but those with BCR-PC reported greater longitudinal fluctuations in PS and pain. Patients who screened positive for depression or anxiety only did so in ~40% of their surveys, and had greater longitudinal variability in their PHQ-9/GAD-7 scores than those who never screened positive.
