In vitro and in vivo studies suggest that ether lipids are anti-inflammatory and protective against obesity. A recent landmark study revealed that ether lipids can kill cancer cells through ferroptosis. However, the role of ether lipids in prostate cancer has not been thoroughly investigated despite the known association of dysregulated lipid metabolism with poorer clinical outcomes. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between the circulating profiles of ether lipids and clinical outcomes in localised and metastatic prostate cancer. Methods: The profiles of ~150 ether lipids (8 lipid classes) in plasma lipidomic data from localised prostate cancer (389 men in Australia) and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC)(2 cohorts –147 men in USA, 128 men in Australia) were analysed for associations with disease progression or overall survival (OS). Open-access genomic data of mCRPC tumours (108 men, CbioPortal) were analysed for aberrations in genes associated with ether lipid metabolism in relation to clinical outcome. Results: Previously in these study cohorts, we had identified men with poorer prognosis based on their plasma lipidome and our validated sphingolipid signature. These men with poorer prognosis have lower plasma levels of ether lipids than those with better prognosis (t-test p < 0.05, localised disease – 110 ether lipids, mCRPC – 54 ether lipids). Decreased plasma levels of up to 46 ether lipid species were associated with higher rates of clinical relapse in localised disease (hazard ratio (HR) range 0.37-0.73, p-value range 0.006-0.049), shorter radiological progression-free survival in mCRPC (HR range 0.35-0.73, p-value range 0.00009-0.049), and shorter OS in mCRPC (HR range 0.33-0.79, p-value range 0.000004-0.0497). Chromosomal loss of tumour GNPAT, an essential gene in ether lipid synthesis, was associated with shorter OS in mCRPC (HR = 1.36, 95% CI 1.02-1.81, p = 0.03). Conclusions: Lower circulating levels of ether lipids were associated with worse prognosis in localised and metastatic prostate cancer, suggesting that these lipids are protective against disease progression. Further research is required to understand the role of ether lipids in disease progression, and to determine if modulation of ether lipid levels through supplementation is beneficial.
