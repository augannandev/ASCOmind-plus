Since CDK12 is the third most commonly altered gene in the HRR pathway in PCa, development of a new treatment strategy is urgently needed. Methods: To understand the biological consequence of CDK12 alteration, CDK12 was knocked out in LNCaP using CRISPR-Cas9 system to generate CDK12KO cells. Cell growth and cell cycle were evaluated as well as HRR efficiency. Downstream genes were evaluated by RT-PCR and western blots. Combination therapy by a PARP inhibitor and ATR inhibitors were tested using two lines of patient derived xenografts (PDX) established from tissues of patients with deleterious CDK12 variants. Three different ATR inhibitors were tested to confirm reproducibility. Results: In LNCaP, CDK12 knockout enhanced cell cycle progression until the M phase, however, cell cycle was stalled at the M phase with accumulation chromosomal aberration, suggesting that rapidly progressive CDK12 altered tumors clinically encountered harbor a mechanism of escaping the M phase checkpoint without DNA repair. γH2AX was accumulated in CDK12KO after treatment with CPT11, consistent with impaired HRR in CDK12 KO cells. Analysis of HRR associated genes showed that in PCa, CDK12 knockout leads to transcriptional downregulation of ATM but not the other HRR associated genes. Expression patterns of downstream genes after double strand break (DSB) induction in CDK12 and ATM knockout cells suggested that in PCa, CDK12 regulates HRR through regulation of ATM. Since synthetic lethality of PARP and ATR inhibition has been reported in ATM deficient PCa, 2 PDX lines with CDK12 alterations were administered the combination therapy. Tumor growth suppression and accumulation of γH2AX in tumor tissue was observed when treated by the combination therapy, but not with either drug alone. Either drug alone or in combination did not affect the growth of a PDX established from a tissue of a patient with wild-type CDK12. Conclusions: In PCa, CDK12 acts through transcriptional regulation of ATM, and combination treatment with PARP inhibitor and ATR inhibitor could be a potential treatment strategy in PCa with CDK12 alteration.
